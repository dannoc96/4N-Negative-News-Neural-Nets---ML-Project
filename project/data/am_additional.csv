Slovenia on Monday designated Hezbollah in its entirety a terrorist organization, joining a growing number of European states who have taken similar steps in recent weeks to end differentiation between the group’s political and armed wings.

In a statement, the small Central European state’s government said that it will henceforth treat the Iranian-backed, Lebanon-based group as “a criminal and terrorist organization posing a threat to peace and security.”
“Hezbollah’s activities are intertwined with organized crime and the conduct of terrorist or paramilitary activities on a global scale,” the government in Ljubljana said in a statement.

The decision followed the recommendations by the Permanent Coordination Group for Restrictive Measures, which is headed by a Slovenian Foreign Ministry official, which presented the government with a report on Hezbollah’s “activities and mode of operation,” according to the statement.

Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi thanked Ljubljana for the move. “This decision joins decisions made in recent months by governments in Europe and Latin American. Hezbollah is an organization that first and foremost hurts Lebanese citizens themselves and takes them hostage to serve Iran’s interests,” he said in a statement.

He called on other nations and on the European Union to follow suit.

Elnet, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting Israel-Europe relations, welcomed Slovenia’s decision. “Slovenia joins a growing number of European countries that made this important step sending a clear message against violence, terrorism, and hatred,” the group said in a statement.

“Hezbollah has a long history of terror and terror-related activities against European targets and in Europe. Further action is necessary on the European level to address these threats.”

Also on Monday, the US State Department hailed Latvia’s recent decision to consider all of Hezbollah a terrorist organization.

“Latvia supports US implementation of sanctions related to Hizballah and has expressed a readiness to place national travel bans on individuals associated with Hizballah,” a spokesperson said in a statement.

“The continued announcements by countries in Europe, Latin America, and other regions of actions against the terrorist organization send a strong message to Hizballah and its backers in Iran that a new day is coming,” the statement went on.

“On this new day, Hizballah operatives will no longer be able to operate from European soil, and the European Union will follow the lead of a number of European governments by closing the loopholes opened up by the false distinction between Hizballah’s so-called military and political wings.”

Until recently, most European countries considered only Hezbollah’s “military wing” a terrorist organization, arguing that its political wing is an integral part of Lebanon’s political landscape.

In the last year and a half, 16 countries announced that they consider the group in its entirety a terrorist organization — nine of them in the last six months — according to the Foreign Ministry. These countries include Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Estonia, Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, Colombia and others.",am,https://www.timesofisrael.com/slovenia-declares-all-of-hezbollah-a-criminal-and-terrorist-organization/
"Vienna IS Terrorist wanted to massacre Catholic Youth group inside Church, investigation reveals","When the shots were fired, 17 people present in the church reacted with the presence of mind and hid after switching off the lights. They stayed hidden until 2:30 AM on Tuesday until the police gave them the all-clear so that they could go home.

As per the report published in Austrian daily Kronen Zeitung, the ISIS terrorist identified as Abu Dagnah Al-Albany, the man behind the attack that took place on November 2 across central Vienna, wanted to cause a bloodbath of the Catholic Youth group in Ruprechtskirche during the prayer time in the evening. He had failed as the door was locked by the timer.

Karl Nehammer, the Interior Minister, is working on increasing the security at the local churches for the Christmas season.

The main target was the Catholic group at the church
When the Catholic Group was holding a non-public prayer hour in the Ruprecht Church, the terrorist wanted to attack with an assault rifle. However, as the gates of the church were locked, he failed. The WEGA agents shot him dead a few moments later in front of the church. The shocked women and children were interviewed by the investigation team “Investigative Group 2 November”.

The authorities have announced that they will release the interim report of the Commission detailing the breakdown of the investigation carried out by anti-terror forces before Christmas.

Attack details provided by Archdiocese official
Michael Prüller, the spokesman of the Vienna Archdiocese, detailed the situation during the attack. When the shots were fired, 17 people present in the church reacted with the presence of mind and hid after switching off the lights. They stayed hidden until 2:30 AM on Tuesday until the police gave them the all-clear so that they could go home.

The Vienna Attack
On November 2, the ISIS terrorist had opened fire across Vienna. As per Vienna Police, at around 8 PM local time, several shots were fired at a busy street in the city centre. The attack happened at six locations. Three, including the attacker, were killed. On November 3, the Vienna authorities confirmed that the attacker was affiliated with the terrorist organization ISIS.

Further investigation revealed that he was released early on terror charges in 2019. At that time, he defended himself by claiming that he went to the ‘wrong mosque’. On November 6, Austria announced that they are shutting down radical mosques that were visited frequently by the terrorist.",am,https://www.opindia.com/2020/12/vienna-isis-terrorist-wanted-bloodbath-catholic-youth-group-inside-church-investigation/
"Two Bellingham women suspected in terrorist attack against BNSF, endangering the public","Two Bellingham women were charged with a terrorist attack and violence against the BNSF Railway Company after they allegedly interfered with the railroad’s safety features last weekend by placing a shunt on the tracks near Bellingham.

Samantha Frances Brooks, 27, and Ellen Brennan Reiche, 23, were booked into the Whatcom County Jail on Sunday, Nov. 29, each on suspicion of malicious injury to railroad property and second-degree criminal trespassing. Jail records show both were transferred into federal custody on Monday, Nov. 30.

Brooks and Reiche appeared in federal court in Seattle on Monday, when they were charged with terrorist attack and other violence against a railroad carrier, according to a U.S. Department of Justice release.

A shunt is an object that disrupts the low-level electrical current on railroad tracks and disables various safety features and can cause derailment, decoupling or failure of gates at crossings, endangering the public, according to the release. Shunts are comprised of wire and magnets stretched between the track so that they can disrupt systems that normally would show when a train is on the tracks.

“Since January there have been 41 incidents of shunts placed on the BNSF tracks in Whatcom and Skagit counties — causing crossing guards to malfunction, interfering with automatic breaking (sic) systems, and, in one case, causing the near-derailment of tanks of hazardous chemicals,” U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran said in the release. “These crimes endanger our community.”

Ten times, shunts disrupted crossing gates at vehicle crossings, according to the release, making it so cars may have crossed tracks unaware that trains were approaching.

On Oct. 11, multiple shunts were placed in three locations in Whatcom and Skagit counties and triggered an automatic braking system on a train transporting hazardous, combustible material, the release states. The emergency braking caused a portion of the train to decouple from the engine, causing a potential derailment of tanker cars carrying flammable gas in a residential area.

“I commend the agents from Customs and Border Protection, FBI, BNSF Police, and state and local partners who prioritized stopping this criminal conduct,” Moran said.

The FBI’s Terrorism Task Force had been investigating shunts being placed on BNSF tracks in the area since Jan. 19, 2020, according to the criminal complaint.

Shortly after the first shunts were discovered in January, the release said that a claim of responsibility was published on an anarchist website.

On Saturday, Nov. 28, BNSF police viewed video surveillance of two people kneeling on tracks near a Bellingham crossing, according to the release. Whatcom County Sheriff’s deputies responded and arrested Brooks and Reiche for trespassing.

Brooks and Reiche had a paper bag containing wire, a drill with a brush head and rubber gloves, according to the release, and the wire was similar to that used in other shunts that had been left.

The shunt that Brooks and Reiche placed on the tracks could have interfered with the railroad crossing signal at Cliffside Drive, south of Bellingham International Airport, the release states.

Convictions for terrorist attacks on railroad facilities could carry up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 file, according to the release.",am,https://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/crime/article247516325.html
Turkish soldier martyred by terrorists in N.Syria,"6 YPG/PKK terrorists also neutralized in Operation Olive Branch zone, south of Turkish border

A Turkish soldier was martyred and six YPG/PKK terrorists were neutralized in the Operation Olive Branch zone in northern Syria, across Turkey’s southern border, the Turkish National Defense Ministry said Thursday.

The soldier was martyred in a clash that broke out to repel an attempt by YPG/PKK terrorists to infiltrate the Olive Branch zone, the ministry said in a statement.

Operations continue with unmanned aerial vehicles and armed drones in the region, it stressed.

The ministry offered condolences to the soldier’s family and the Turkish nation.

Turkish authorities use the term “neutralize"" to imply the terrorists in question surrendered or were killed or captured.

Turkey liberated the zone from terrorists last year, but YPG/PKK terrorists occasionally try to infiltrate it to disrupt the stability and peace established there.

Since 2016, Turkey has launched a trio of successful anti-terror operations in northern Syria, across its border, to prevent the formation of a terror corridor and to enable the peaceful settlement of residents: Euphrates Shield (2016), Olive Branch (2018), and Peace Spring (2019).

In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK –listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and the EU– has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children, and infants.",am,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkish-soldier-martyred-by-terrorists-in-nsyria/2064369
"Benbrika in touch with IS fighters and jailed terrorists, court told","Convicted terror plotter Abdul Nacer Benbrika made contact while in prison with Islamic State fighters and people who were later jailed for terrorism offences, a court was told during an application to keep him locked up.

Benbrika has completed a 15-year jail term over a plot to bomb Melbourne's Crown casino and the MCG but the federal government wants a Supreme Court judge to order he stay in prison for another three years out of concern that he still poses a risk to the community.

Abdul Nacer Benbrika was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2009 for leading a Melbourne-based terrorist cell.
Abdul Nacer Benbrika was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2009 for leading a Melbourne-based terrorist cell.

People convicted of terror offences can be kept in detention for up to three years after their sentence ends if a supreme court grants an application by the home affairs minister. Despite having finished his jail term, Benbrika remains in prison while Justice Andrew Tinney considers the government's application.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has cancelled Benbrika's Australian citizenship, which means he will be deported to his native Algeria when he is released from prison. However, the government argues the best way to ensure he does not reoffend is to keep him in prison here.

Benbrika's lawyers oppose the application and argue the 60-year has completed his jail term.

On Mondya, the first day of a trial to decide what happens to Benbrika was told Australian authorities monitored 19 people who were in contact with him after his arrest in 2005. The contacts, including Khaled Sharrouf and another man, who both joined and fought for Islamic State in the Middle East, were tracked via intercepted phone calls, visits and correspondence.

Khaled Sharrouf: a follower of Abdel Nacer Benbrika, he went on to join Islamic State and was killed in Syria.
Khaled Sharrouf: a follower of Abdel Nacer Benbrika, he went on to join Islamic State and was killed in Syria.

Two of Benbrika's sons and men who were later jailed for terrorism offences were also among those who were in contact with the leader while he was in custody and who have caused alarm for authorities.

Rowena Orr, QC, acting for the Home Affairs Department, said national authorities, counter-terrorism officials and forensic psychologists who had interviewed Benbrika all believed he maintained an adherence to extreme Islamic ideology, supported the use of violent jihad, radicalised others and was influential over those who regarded him as a guiding figure.

""Nothing has changed"" about Benbrika's beliefs and devotion to his cause since his arrest in 2005, Ms Orr told Justice Tinney.

Ms Orr spent all of Monday outlining the government's case for Benbrika to remain in prison, which included reading transcripts of intercepted conversations the prisoner had with associates while he was behind bars.

Abdul Nacer Benbrika has served 15 years in prison.

In one conversation, Benbrika had praise and admiration for those behind the 2001 terror attacks on the US and on London in 2005, and justified the killing of ""innocents"", including children, women and the elderly, in the name of his extremist beliefs.

""As a Muslim you are allowed to get your revenge,"" Benbrika told the associate.

Part of the motivation behind Benbrika's plot to bomb the casino and MCG was to coerce the Australian government to withdraw its troops from Iraq.

""If they mutilate we are allowed to mutilate ... it's our right,"" Benbrika said in one of the recorded conversations read to court.

Ms Orr also played a 2005 interview of Benbrika with the ABC's The 7.30 Report in which he labelled terror leader Osama bin Laden ""a great man"", said there was ""an Australian law and an Islamic law"", and justified the use of violence for extremist religious beliefs.

""According to my religion, jihad is a part of my religion,"" Benbrika said in the 2005 interview. He was arrested later that year and has been in custody ever since. He was found guilty at trial in 2008 and formally sentenced in 2009.

Ms Orr told Justice Tinney that psychologists found Benbrika still adhered to violent extremism, had the ability to influence, indoctrinate and radicalise his followers and lacked insight and remorse for his offending, other than that for himself and his family.

His claims to authorities that he had denounced his radical beliefs were self-serving attempts to get parole, Ms Orr said, and there was no evidence he had changed his views.

B enbrika denied sentence reduction
The leader of a terrorist cell convicted of plotting to wage violent jihad on Australian soil has failed to have his sentence reduced on appeal.

Lawyers for the government argue that if released from prison, Benbrika poses a high risk of engaging in terrorist acts, training and recruiting others and funding and supporting terror organisations. His being abroad would make it difficult for Australian authorities to monitor him.

""The safety and protection of the community requires that the defendant remains in detention for at least the next three years,"" Ms Orr said.

Benbrika's lawyers are yet to address Justice Tinney.

Benbrika watched Monday's hearing on a video link from prison and the only time he spoke was to ask Ms Orr to speak into the microphone so he could hear.

Ms Orr will continue outlining the government's case on Tuesday. The trial is expected to run this week.",am,https://www.smh.com.au/national/benbrika-in-touch-with-is-fighters-and-jailed-terrorists-court-told-20201130-p56j8u.html
Former journalist charged with planning terrorist attack in Queensland,"James Waugh faced court on Saturday charged with ‘planning to undertake a terrorist act in the Bundaberg region’

A former journalist has been charged with allegedly planning a terrorist attack in the regional Queensland city of Bundaberg.

James Waugh faced a Brisbane court on Saturday after he was charged by police on Friday with planning a terrorist act for the Bundaberg region. Police also allege the 29-year-old had “sought firearms training”.

A Queensland joint counter-terrorism team allegedly found a number of electronic devices and a notebook when officers searched Waugh’s Kepnock address on 3 November after he allegedly threatened a member of the public.

Australian federal police and Queensland police in a joint statement said the seized documents indicated “a desire to undertake acts of violent extremism”.

AFP assistant commissioner Scott Lee said the decision to charge Waugh was made “to prevent a terrorist attack in Australia and to protect the community”.

Cheryl Scanlon, a Queensland police assistant commissioner, said the arrest was a credit to the hard work and “commitment to community safety” of law enforcement agencies.

Waugh did not apply for bail when he faced Brisbane arrest court on Saturday, according to Nine News. He is due to face court again in December on the terrorism charge that carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Waugh previously worked for several different news outlets, including the Queanbeyan Age and Canberra Chronicle, the ABC reported.

NJ Woman With Military Background Arrested for Alleged Syrian Terrorist Support,"The 53-year-old hospital analyst and political activist allegedly provided money and tactical advice to the al-Nusra Front

The FBI arrested a woman for allegedly helping aid al Qaeda-linked terrorists overseas, and seized a cache of firearms during a raid at her home in Hopatcong. NBC New York’s Jonathan Dienst reports.

What to Know
Maria Bell, a hospital analyst from New Jersey, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly providing financial and tactical support to terrorists in Syria
Bell, 53, is an Army veteran who was allegedly stopped once from going to Turkey and was trying to head there again
An FBI search of her home Wednesday turned up a significant cache of guns
FBI agents arrested a New Jersey woman early Wednesday on federal charges of providing material support to the al-Nusra Front, a terrorist group described as al-Qaeda in Syria.

Maria Bell, 53, of Hopatcong, is charged with providing material support to the al-Nusra Front, also known as the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which operates in northwest Syria. A search of her home Wednesday morning turned up a significant cache of weapons.

Bell served in the U.S. Army National Guard and on active duty in the Army for a total of 14 months from late 1984 to early 1986.  She received an “other than honorable discharge"" in lieu of a court martial, according to court papers.

Between 2017 and 2018 she allegedly used encrypted applications to communicate with one HTS member with whom she had an online relationship. She allegedly gave advice on the purchase of weapons and ammunition, planned to meet him in Turkey, and sent him money.

Bell -- who was previously stopped by the FBI from traveling to Turkey -- was planning to fly to Egypt on Wednesday and then on to Istanbul, according to an FBI affidavit filed Tuesday.

She appeared via videoconference in federal court in Newark Wednesday afternoon, and was ordered detained without bail. Not date has been set for a future hearing. Bell's attorney declined to comment.

""Have no doubt, we believe she was a threat to New Jersey and certainly our country,"" said New Jersey Homeland Security Director Jared Maples.

""No matter what anyone looks like, no matter what religion they practice, that's not what factors into this. The behaviors factor into this and I think this case is one of the clearest examples of that,"" Maples said. ""You don't get to pick who you dislike, that they dislike. They all hate us. They hate our way of life. They certainly are espousing ideologies to attack Americans and certainly something that we are on point and worried about.""

Bell's employer, Atlantic Health System, where she worked as an analyst, said she has been suspended. She was also chair of the New Jersey Libertarian Party's northern New Jersey branch. The party, in a statement, said its board removed her from her position and cancelled her membership, and it condemned violence as well.

The U.S. Attorney's Office said the single charge of concealment of terrorist financing to a designated foreign terrorist organization carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.",am,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/nj-woman-with-military-background-arrested-for-alleged-syrian-terrorist-support/2745551/
France train attack: Four men go on trial in Paris over foiled Thalys terrorist shooting,"Four men went on trial in Paris on Monday over a foiled terrorist attack on board a high-speed international train in the summer of 2015.

Ayoub El-Khazzani stands accused of opening fire on a Thalys train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015, three months before the Paris terror attacks on November 13.

Two people were wounded in the attack before the shooter was subdued by three American passengers, two of whom were soldiers.

Three others are on trial suspected of helping El-Khazzani plan the attack. Bilal Chatra, Redouane El-Amrani Ezzerrifi and Mohamed Bakkali face lesser charges, including conspiring with terrorists and accomplices to attempted murder.

European leaders lay out fresh plans to fight religious extremism
Five years after Paris' deadly terror attacks, the scars remain
If found guilty, El-Khazzani could face a life sentence over charges of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.

El-Khazzani is believed to have joined the so-called Islamic State group in Syria in May 2015. That summer, he set off for Europe from Turkey with his sponsor, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who led the jihadist cell in Belgium that planned the Paris attacks on November 13.

According to the investigators, the Thalys attack was part of a series of jihadist attacks planned from Syria: the aborted attack against a church in Villejuif in the Paris suburbs which was perpetrated in April 2015 by Sid-Ahmed Ghlam who was also recently sentenced to life imprisonment, the November attacks in Paris and those of March 22, 2016, in Brussels.


On August 21, 2015, El-Khazzani, then 25 years old, boarded the Amsterdam-Paris train in Brussels. He went to the toilet, took off his shirt, put a pistol in his belt and a Kalashnikov across his shoulder.

Three American tourists were alerted by a commotion when passengers opened the toilet door and disturbed him. They managed to throw themselves on him, disarm him and overpower him with the help of other passengers. The train then stopped at Arras station in France where the attacker was arrested.

""He had enough ammunition to kill 300 people,"" insisted lawyer Thibault de Montbrial, who is representing the Americans, adding he didn't doubt a ""mass attack"" had been avoided.

After keeping his silence for over a year and a half, El-Khazzani told investigators that Abaaoud, killed by the police shortly after the November 13 attacks, had asked him to target only Americans citizens.

Castex says France will continue to 'relentlessly' fight 'radical Islamism'
France attack: What do we know about the deadly stabbings in Nice?
El-Khazzani's assertions were deemed ""not serious"" by the team investigating the attack as Abaaoud was at that time preparing the November attacks against civilians. The presence of the Americans on this train was also believed to be impossible to anticipate.

The Americans, now 28 years old, will be present at the hearing on Thursday and Friday, when the testimonies of the passengers on the train are scheduled to be heard, their lawyer told the court.

The three men were celebrated as heroes in France, receiving the Legion of Honour at the Elysée Palace for their actions.

Barcelona terror attack: three in court in Madrid,"Trio accused of links to deadly van attack on La Rambla in 2017 and subsequent assault in nearby coastal town

Three men have appeared in court in Madrid to face trial over their alleged roles in the 2017 terror attacks in Catalonia that left 16 people dead and 140 wounded.

The perpetrators of the atrocities – Spain’s worst terror attack since the Madrid train bombings in March 2004 – used a van to knock down pedestrians on Barcelona’s La Rambla boulevard on 17 August 2017 and then staged another assault the following day in the Catalan coastal town of Cambrils.

Local police shot the five Cambrils attackers dead at the scene while officers killed the Barcelona attacker a few days later. Isis claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying their authors were “soldiers of the Islamic State”.

One of those on trial, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, said the cell had been planning larger scale bomb attacks against targets including Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia church, but had changed their plans after an explosion tore through the house where the plotters were staying in the coastal town of Alcanar.

The Catalan police, the Mossos d’Esquadra, also said the blast had deprived the group of the capacity to stage an even deadlier attack.

“The explosion in Alcanar meant they no longer had the necessary material to plan larger scale attacks in Barcelona,” said Josep Lluís Trapero, head of the force at the time. “They were probably trying to carry out a different kind of attack.”

Chemlal was injured in the blast, which killed two of the plotters, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam suspected of radicalising and organising the cell.

Prosecutors are seeking a 41-year jail term for Chemlal on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit terrorist acts. But, like his co-accused, Chemlal is not facing murder charges.

Driss Oukabir, whose brother was one of the attackers shot dead in Cambrils, faces the same charges as Chemlal, for which prosecutors are seeking a 36-year sentence. The 31-year-old has admitted hiring the van used in the Barcelona attack, but claims he believed the vehicle had been hired for a house move.

The third defendant, Said Ben Iazza, 27, faces an eight-year sentence on charges of collaborating with a terror group for allegedly lending the conspirators his identity documents and a van “that he knew would be used to buy and transport chemical products”.

The head of one of the victims’ associations that is acting as a civil party in the proceedings said he would push for the accused to answer for the deaths of those murdered in the attacks.

“[We’re] going to fight for a murder charge and sentence for the accused ... regardless of how close or far they were from the van [used in Barcelona],” said Eulogio Paz.

The trial is expected to run until 16 December.",am,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/barcelona-terror-attack-three-in-court-in-madrid
"New Zealand mosque gunman pleads guilty to murder, terrorism","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The man who committed the worst atrocity in New Zealand’s modern history when he slaughtered 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges Thursday.

The attacks targeting people praying at the mosques a year ago shocked the nation and prompted new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. It also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.

The sudden turn in the case took survivors and relatives by surprise, and brought relief to people across New Zealand. Many had feared Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant would try to use his trial as a platform to promote his views. He’d outlined those views in a 74-page manifesto he published online shortly before the attacks.

Tarrant, 29, pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism at the Christchurch High Court. He had previously pleaded not guilty to all charges and his trial had been scheduled to start in June.

Tarrant is the first person to be found guilty of terrorism in New Zealand under laws passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S.

The change in plea came less than two weeks after New Zealanders commemorated those who died on the anniversary of the March 15, 2019, attacks.

“Honestly, I’m still trying to process what just happened,” said Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the attack on the Al Noor mosque. “I feel conflicted.”

She said that on the one hand, she had wanted to find out more details about what happened at the trial but on the other hand was feeling relieved about not having to face the trauma of sitting through it.

Temel Atacocugu, who survived being shot nine times during the attack at Al Noor, said he was surprised by the turn of events and hoped the judge would set an example at the sentencing by imposing the harshest punishment in the country’s history and helping ensure nothing like it would happen again.

“I’m happy that he has accepted that he is guilty,” Atacocugu said.

,Judge Cameron Mander has not yet set a sentencing date. Tarrant faces life imprisonment, with the judge having some discretion in deciding the minimum number of years Tarrant must serve before becoming eligible for parole.

The change in plea came at a hastily arranged court hearing at a time that New Zealand was beginning a four-week lockdown to try and combat the new coronavirus. The lockdown meant Tarrant appeared in the court via video link from his jail cell in Auckland and only a handful of people were allowed inside the courtroom, including the imams from the two mosques that were attacked.

Mander said it was unfortunate the lockdown prevented victims and family members from being able to attend the hearing but the imams were helping to represent them. He said he wanted to quickly move ahead with the hearing, especially with the COVID-19 response threatening delays to the court schedule.

Tarrant, who was wearing a gray prison sweater, showed little emotion as he pleaded guilty. He didn’t indicate why he had changed his pleas, and his lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised around the world for her empathetic response to the Muslim community after the attacks, said it was “deeply disappointing” the victims didn’t get to attend the hearing.

But she said there was “a certain sense of relief that the whole nation, but particularly our Muslim community, are being spared from a trial that could have otherwise acted as a platform.”

Tarrant moved to New Zealand in 2017 and kept a low profile in the university city of Dunedin. He frequented a gym, practiced shooting at a rifle club range and built up an arsenal of weapons. He didn’t appear to be employed, and said in some online posts that he’d inherited a significant amount of money when his father died.

Tarrant appeared to have a fascination with religious conflicts in Europe and the Balkans, and visited a number of sites in Eastern Europe in the years before he committed the massacre. After his attack at the second mosque, Tarrant was driving, possibly to carry out a shooting at a third mosque, when two police officers rammed his car off the road, dragged him out and arrested him.",am,https://apnews.com/article/f7dcfcdf74e92eb4a1c2940def5522d4
Mississauga man charged in connection with India call centre scam,"A 25-year-old Mississauga man is facing charges for his alleged involvement in a number of telephone scams, including the widespread CRA scam. 

On Dec. 3, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced that officers have charged another individual in connection with transnational telephone frauds, including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) telephone scam, the bank investigator scam and the tech support scam.

Police charged Thomas Pao with fraud over $5,000, possession of proceeds of crime and laundering of the proceeds of crime. 

A Canada-wide arrest warrant has been issued for the accused, who is currently believed to be in China.

The RCMP GTA Financial Crime Section launched Project Octavia, which investigates such frauds, in 2018.

“The focus of the investigation was to combat the CRA telephone tax schemes and other interrelated frauds through public awareness, disruption, and enforcement,” the RCMP said in a statement.

“These telephone fraudsters who are operating outside of Canada, have been targeting the Canadian public since 2014. Despite a number of police raids on illegal call centres in India, and arrests in Canada, these fraudsters continue to change their facade and target Canadians.” 

The RCMP says that between 2014 and 2020, the CRA scam alone cost victims over $18.5 million.

To date, nine individuals have been charged in relation to Project OCTAVIA.

“Fraud, like violent crime, has devastating consequences on its victims. Those whose conscience does not deter them from preying on the vulnerable, will be held accountable by the rule of law,” said Staff Sergeant Ken Derakhshan, acting Officer in Charge of the GTA Financial Crime Section in Milton, in a statement.

“The RCMP will continue to investigate those who participate in trans-national criminal organizations to defraud Canadians.

Sydney man Mario Seifried has now been handed a criminal conviction and fined $1,500 after appearing before the Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday.

Mr Seifried, an executive manager at Commonwealth Bank (CBA) at the time of the offence, had lodged two income tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 financial years, falsely claiming a range of car, travel, self-education and other work-related expenses that he had not legitimately incurred.

In his 2016 return, Mr Seifried claimed to have incurred more than $15,000 worth of travel expenses for overseas conferences, but the bank had no record of him submitting any international or domestic travel requests for this period.

Records obtained from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection also confirmed that he did not leave the country during the 2016 financial year.

On the self-education front, Mr Seifried attempted to claim expenses for a course his employer had already paid for and a master of business administration that he had already undertaken.

The ATO noted that Mr Seifried wrongfully obtained $24,239 in refunds, but has since repaid this amount.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Seifried left CBA in mid-2019, and is now the head of anti-financial crime at National Australia Bank.",am,https://www.investordaily.com.au/regulation/48272-nab-financial-crime-exec-charged-with-financial-crimes
RCMP charge two more fraudsters as part of Project Octavia,"MILTON, ON, Nov. 27, 2020 /CNW/ - Members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Financial Crime Section, Toronto West Detachment (TWD) in Milton, Ontario, have charged two individuals in connection with transnational telephone frauds, including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) telephone scam, the Bank investigator scam, and the Tech support scam.

To address the victimization of Canadians, in October of 2018, the RCMP GTA Financial Crime Section commenced an investigation, named Project OCTAVIA. The focus of the investigation was to combat the CRA telephone tax schemes and other interrelated frauds through public awareness, disruption, and enforcement. These telephone fraudsters who are operating outside of Canada, have been targeting the Canadian public since 2014. Despite a number of police raids on illegal call centres in India, and arrests in Canada, these fraudsters continue to change their façade and target Canadians.

Cumulatively between 2014 and 2020, the CRA scam alone has resulted in reported victim losses totaling over $18.5 million.  As of October 1, 2020, between the CRA, the Bank investigator and Tech support scams, the total reported victim losses are over $34 million. During this investigation, RCMP investigators uncovered ""money mules /money mule managers"", and money launderers operating within Canada and overseas.

Charged are Vimal Shrestha (age 41) and Bindisha Joshi (age 41) of Lalitpur/Kathmandu, Nepal with:

Fraud over $5,000, contrary to the Criminal Code;
Possession of proceeds of crime, contrary to the Criminal Code;
Laundering of the proceeds of crime, contrary to the Criminal Code.
Canada-wide arrest warrants have been issued for both Mr. Shrestha and Ms. Joshi as they are believed to be in Nepal.

""The serious criminal charges that the two accused are facing sends a clear message:  International borders will not cloak offenders with immunity from apprehension and prosecution.  Transnational fraudsters who target Canadian victims, will be investigated, charged, and prosecuted, said Staff Sergeant Ken Derakhshan, acting Officer in Charge of the GTA Financial Crime Section in Milton. ""The dedication and cooperation amongst international law enforcement agencies will inevitably lead to the acquisition of crucial evidence and the identification of suspects, irrespective of their location in the world.",am,https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/rcmp-charge-two-more-fraudsters-as-part-of-project-octavia-839828906.html
"Pickering man, 43, charged in fraud that cost company $5.4 million","Police say they have charged an employee of a company in Markham, Ont. after he allegedly defrauded his employer of more than $5.4 million.

York Regional Police say their Financial Crimes Unit began investigating in August after a forensic audit showed that the business located on Gough Road, near 14th Avenue and Warden Avenue, had millions of dollars paid out to an unknown company.

An employee who worked as the company’s controller was suspected of moving the funds into a private company he had set up, according to investigators.

It was discovered that the employee had transferred more than $5.4 million to his personal company.

Steve Ramcharan, 43, of Pickering was arrested on Sept. 15 and charged with fraud over $5,000 as well as criminal breach of trust.

He is scheduled to appear in a Newmarket courtroom on Jan. 8.

Canada seeks extradition of alleged financial fraudster to face charges in B.C.,"An extradition hearing took place on Oct. 12 at South Cumbria Magistrates’ Court in England, in a small community 80 kilometres north of Liverpool, in the area where Miller lives.

Britain is considering whether to extradite a 71-year-old man to Canada who faces 13 charges each of fraud and theft in British Columbia.

Canada made the rare request to the British government on behalf of the B.C. Prosecution Service, which is seeking Peter Kevin Miller’s return to Canada to face the criminal charges related to investment fraud that is alleged to have happened between 2010 and 2013 in the Vancouver area.
 
The charges — of fraud in excess of $5,000 and theft over $5,000 — were filed on Jan. 30, 2017, following an investigation by the Vancouver Police Department.

An extradition hearing took place on Oct. 12 at South Cumbria Magistrates’ Court in England, in a small community 80 kilometres north of Liverpool, in the area where Miller lives.

According to the British Crown Prosecution Service, the case has been sent to the country’s Home Secretary office for an extradition decision, which could take up to two months.

Article content continued
Miller can appeal a decision by Britain to extradite him.

Few details of the alleged investment fraud are available, but Vancouver lawyer Gary Botting, who has expertise in extraditions and appeals, said it is unusual for Canada to seek an extradition for financial crime.

He said most extradition cases in Canada involve sending Canadians to the U.S. to face criminal charges there.

Botting, who has practised law for more than 25 years, said he had not heard of a case where Canada had followed through on a financial crime of this kind and extradited anybody back to Canada.

“It’s got to be a vast amount of money for them to be interested in going through the all the expense of an extradition. And it would have to be widespread, probably,” said Botting.

The extradition request is also noteworthy because criminal prosecutions of financial fraud are rare in British Columbia, according to a 2017 Postmedia investigation.

During a 10-year period between 2008 and 2017, significant criminal prosecutions included a six-year jail sentence in 2016 for notary Rashida Samji for carrying out a Ponzi scheme where investors lost about $11 million and a nine-year sentence for fraudster Ian Thow in 2010 for taking $6 million from his clients in investments that did not exist.

But just six other police-investigated cases landed fraudsters in jail during the 10-year period.

In the extradition hearing in England, it was alleged that between November 2010 and January 2013, in or near Vancouver, Miller appropriated monies from Gordon and Isabelle Truscott by using the money they had invested. Similar charges were listed of Miller making false representations to several other people.

Article content continued
Miller was given bail but had to post a £100,000 security, which is about $175,000 in Canadian currency.

The Vancouver Police Department refused to comment on the case — its scope, the number of victims or amount of money alleged to have been lost — saying it was because it is before the courts.

A victim contacted by Postmedia alleged investors received periodic returns or dividends that stopped at the same time as Miller disappeared.

The person, who did not wish to be named, and who learned about the investment through a friend, said Miller was reported to police when the payments stopped and he could not be found.

The person said their losses were a few thousand dollars but believed others had lost much more.

In the 1980s, in Florida, Miller was charged along with two lawyers in an alleged scheme to lure British citizens into the United States illegally.

The charges, which included fraud, were later thrown out.

According to a South Florida Sun-Sentinel article in 1988, alleged victims of the scheme said Miller put ads in British newspapers and told them he could help them immigrate to the U.S. by investing into local companies that promised high-financial returns and American work visas.

The pitch was that a $75,000 investment into two Florida businesses would gain valid U.S. visas.

An estimated 50 British subjects became involved, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

One Briton who lost $75,000 in the immigration venture said he won a $105,000 court judgment against Miller but in 1988 he had not collected any money, the Sun-Sentinel reported.

Canada’s Justice Department, which holds the authority to make extradition requests, would say little about the request to extradite Miller from Britain.

“When making a request for extradition to another country, the request is not filed in Canadian courts, but is sent on a confidential basis to the requested state,” said Department of Justice spokesman Ian McLeod in an email.",am,https://vancouversun.com/business/extradition-from-britain-of-alleged-financial-fraudster-sought-to-canada
"Former Australian executive arrested, charged over alleged oil bribery plot","Australia's longest-running bribery investigation came to a head on Wednesday with the arrest in Queensland of a former senior executive from construction giant Leighton Holdings over his alleged involvement in a $1 billion international graft scandal.

The charging of Russell Waugh comes after two Monaco-based brothers turned police supergrasses and agreed to testify in Australia.

Former Leighton executive Russell Waugh arrested in Brisbane on alleged bribery charges involving Unaoil.
Former Leighton executive Russell Waugh arrested in Brisbane on alleged bribery charges involving Unaoil.

Mr Waugh is the first of at least three top Australian executives to face charges in connection to the Unaoil conspiracy, which involved bribes paid to ministers and officials in oil producing nations around the world, and which has already led to the jailing or guilty pleas of executives in Europe and the US. There is no suggestion Mr Waugh is guilty, only that he is facing two counts of conspiracy to bribe Iraqi officials.

Australian Federal Police deputy commissioner Ian McCartney said the charges were part of a ""hugely significant"" investigation that had taken nine years and involved unpicking ""a really complex jigsaw puzzle"" of intermediary companies in 10 countries.

Mr Waugh is a former managing director of Leighton Offshore who later worked as the chief executive of listed firm UGL – a job he lost only when The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald broke the Unaoil story in 2016 about his alleged corruption. He was arrested on Wednesday morning at his Brisbane home.

Mr Waugh allegedly masterminded a plot between March 2010 and mid-2012 that involved bribing high-ranking Iraqi officials in return for $1.4 billion of Iraqi government oil pipeline contracts for Leighton.

Those bribed are, according to leaked files, a former deputy prime minister of Iraq and two former oil ministers.

Bribery or Corporations Act charges are also expected to be brought against at least two other former top executives from Leighton, a listed firm now called CIMIC. Court files identify those to be charged as David Savage who is currently in France, and Peter Cox who is in Asia. Both may face extradition.

Mr Waugh is the most senior executive from an ASX-listed company to be charged with foreign bribery offences in Australia since the laws were passed in 1999 and his arrest marks a major breakthrough in an Australian Federal Police investigation that has cost millions of dollars.

Deputy commissioner McCartney said the arrests showed the commitment of the Australian Federal Police to international bribery investigations.

""It's a serious crime ... there is a misconception that foreign bribery is just the cost of doing business. It isn't. Foreign bribery ... reflects poorly on our national character and inflicts generational economic damage on the countries impacted.""

He said the police were continuing to investigate if the Commonwealth could recoup the financial benefit enjoyed by Leighton, now CIMIC, under proceeds of crimes laws.

One financial crime investigator based in Canberra warned that AFP command is divided about whether to invest in complex fraud and bribery inquiries because they are time-consuming and difficult to prosecute.

The charging of Mr Waugh was made possible by the decision of brothers Cyrus and Saman Ahsani of Monaco to co-operate with the Australian government after they were charged by the FBI in 2019 for Unaoil's vast-scale bribery operation, which was exposed via a massive data leak to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald in March 2016. At least 25 multinational firms were involved, including Leighton.

According to court files, the case against Mr Waugh alleges he conspired with the Ahsanis, who are expected to testify that he was involved in clandestine meetings and suspect money trails to hide bribes being paid by Leighton but handed over to officials by Unaoil.

The Ahsanis will allege that Mr Waugh as well as Mr Cox and Mr Savage were involved in the payment of kickbacks between March 2010 and mid 2012. Those bribed are, according to leaked files separately obtained by The Age and Herald, a former deputy prime minister of Iraq and two former oil ministers. If Mr Waugh is found guilty he could face up to 10 years in jail.

Brothers Saman and Cyrus Ahsani and their father Ata Ahsani: the men behind Unaoil.
Brothers Saman and Cyrus Ahsani and their father Ata Ahsani: the men behind Unaoil.

According to court files, Mr Waugh is also alleged to have used a shadowy UAE firm, Asian Global Projects and Trading, to funnel $5.6 million in suspect payments to win contracts in Iraq. In 2018 he faced false accounting charges laid by corporate watchdog ASIC over unrelated dealings he had with Asian Global in connection with Leighton's Indian operations. In December 2018, Mr Waugh was found not guilty. The federal police case involves new allegations.

In the US, authorities are also investigating CIMIC over Leighton’s alleged bribery as part of the FBI’s sprawling Unaoil corruption inquiry. If the company is charged, the penalties could run into hundreds of millions of dollars, on par with the US government’s cases against other companies who hired Unaoil to pay their bribes such as UK behemoth Rolls Royce.

The AFP charges were prompted after the Unaoil reports in The Age and Herald in 2016, which also led to corruption probes across the globe. Unaoil was hired by Leighton Holdings’s offshore arm to help it secure work in Iraq as part of the Australian company’s international expansion plans under the leadership of chief executive Wal King. Mr King remained CEO until early 2011

There is no suggestion in the Australian case that Mr King knew of the alleged bribery in Iraq, although the case against Mr Waugh alleges that the bribery took place during Mr King’s last eight months as Leighton CEO.

The brazenness of Unaoil’s criminal offending was laid bare in an unsealed indictment filed in the US in 2019. The US government has accused Unaoil of paying bribes on behalf of up to 25 multinational firms over more than a decade.

To protect their scheme the Ahsani brothers issued legal threats and claims of innocence while shredding files. The Ahsanis were actively destroying evidence in March and April 2016 at the same time as Unaoil was instructing its Australian lawyer to threaten The Age and the Herald with defamation suits and to brief reporters from other media outlets on the Ahsanis’ innocence and the unfairness of the journalism that had exposed their corruption.

Along with bribery and money laundering, Unaoil executives Cyrus and Saman Ahsani have pleaded guilty in the US to having “destroyed incriminating documents with the intent to prevent their discovery by law enforcement”. The Ahsanis are awaiting sentencing in the US.

Two men plead guilty to financial crimes,"Fan Wang pleaded guilty in federal court today to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

His guilty plea is the fourth in this ongoing investigation targeting operators of unlawful underground financial institutions that transfer money between the United States and China, thereby circumventing domestic and foreign laws regarding monetary transfers and reporting, including United States anti-money laundering scrutiny and Chinese capital flight controls.

As part of his agreement to plead guilty, Wang agreed to forfeit $225,000 to the United States as property involved in the operation of his unlicensed money transmitting business.

As admitted in the plea agreement entered today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel E. Butcher, Wang sold hard currency in U.S. dollars that he collected from various third parties. His customers were typically individuals with bank accounts in China who could not readily access cash in the United States due to capital controls that cap the amount of Chinese yuan that an individual can convert to foreign currency.

Often these customers needed the money to gamble at the casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere. Upon receiving U.S. dollars, the customers would transfer from a Chinese bank account an equivalent value in yuan, over their mobile phones in the United States, to a separate bank account in China designated by Wang.

As part of a typical money exchange transaction, Wang was introduced to his customers by a casino host whose job it was to facilitate that customer’s play at a particular casino.

The customer then used the U.S. currency to gamble.

Sentencing is scheduled for January 29, 2021.

Extending the series of guilty pleas in this investigation, Jeffrey B. Miklus of Phoenix, Arizona, admitted to tax fraud, after using funds from his business to fund his gambling activity at casinos throughout the southwestern United States.

As admitted this morning in his plea agreement that was also entered before U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel E. Butcher, Miklus withdrew over $1.5 million dollars from his pest control business, and used these proceeds to gamble—all without reporting that income to the IRS.

This activity spanned years, resulting in restitution and taxes due and owing to the IRS of more than $650,000, an amount that will grow with interest and a 75 percent fraud penalty.

As a material term of his plea agreement, Miklus must satisfy the tax due in full before his sentencing date.

Sentencing for Miklus is scheduled for January 31, 2021.

Tanzanian journalist freed after pleading guilty to financial crimes,"Tanzanian journalist Erick Kabendera, who was held in jail for seven months in a case that prompted international concern, was freed on Monday after pleading guilty to financial crimes.

Kabendera, a reporter for local and international press outlets, was initially detained for questioning over his citizenship before the charges were upgraded to sedition.

But both lines of enquiry were dropped, and Kabendera was charged in August with tax evasion, money laundering and organized crime.

His detention provoked outrage, with rights groups demanding Kabendera be released and warnings that the case reflected worsening press freedoms under President John Magufuli, who came to power in 2015.

After plea bargaining the count of organized crime was dropped, and Kabendera pleaded guilty to counts of money laundering and failure to pay 173 million shillings ($74,000, 69,000 euros) in taxes.

Kabendera was freed after paying a 250,000 shilling fine for failing to pay taxes, but has to pay another 100 million shillings in fines for money laundering.

The journalist, whose case has been postponed multiple times, with him even being denied release to attend his mother’s funeral, said he “appreciates the support of everyone.”

“I have gone through difficult times and finally I am free. I did not expect this but I am grateful for all the support,” he said.
Defence lawyer Jebra Kambole said the remaining fine would be paid in instalments.

The United States and Britain have voiced concern at the “steady erosion of due process” in Tanzania, citing Kabendera’s plight as a case in point.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) - which has labelled Magufuli a “press freedom predator” - and Amnesty International, among other rights groups, had demanded Kabendera’s immediate release.

Kabendera had written about being stalked and harassed in the years since Magufuli’s election.

Former HPD Police Chief And Prosecutor Wife Sentenced To Prison,"Katherine Kealoha and her husband, retired Honolulu police chief Louis Kealoha, are at the center of a years long investigation into public corruption.

Katherine and Louis Kealoha, once seen as pillars of Hawaii’s law enforcement community, will spend the next several years in federal prison.

On Monday morning, U.S. District Court Judge J. Michael Seabright sentenced Katherine Kealoha, a former deputy prosecutor for the City and County of Honolulu, to 13 years behind bars for trying to frame her uncle for stealing her mailbox in 2013.

Later that afternoon Seabright ordered her husband, Louis Kealoha, who took part in that scheme as Honolulu’s police chief, to serve a seven-year prison term.

The couple, now estranged, will be forced to pay nearly $700,000 in restitution to their victims, which includes the estate of Katherine Kealoha’s deceased grandmother, Florence Puana.

Louis and Katherine Kealoha are at the center of a major investigation into police corruption.

At least some of that money will come from Louis Kealoha’s Honolulu Police Department pension, which pays him about $9,700 a month.

Seabright described the case as a “grotesque deprivation of civil rights” that harmed an entire community and caused lasting damage to the integrity of the HPD and the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney’s Office.

“The events underlying this case have had a real and measurable impact on our community,” Seabright said. “The conduct of the defendants — all of the defendants — have truly shaken confidence in our governing institutions, most notably HPD.”

The motive behind the frame job was simple — money.

Gerard Puana and his mother, Florence, had filed a lawsuit against Katherine Kealoha in March 2013, alleging that she had bilked them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars years before through a shady reverse mortgage deal and sham investment scheme.

That lawsuit began to uncover a series of financial crimes that the Kealohas had committed, not the least of which was Katherine stealing from her uncle and grandmother to fuel a lavish lifestyle.

The Kealohas used the stolen money for trips to Disneyland, Elton John concert tickets and Maserati car payments.

They also used the funds to pay for Louis Kealoha’s inaugural celebration at the Sheraton Waikiki after he was named Honolulu’s police chief. The bill for the soiree was nearly $25,000.

“They unabashedly used the power given to them to feed their greed,” Seabright said.

A jury convicted the Kealohas and two Honolulu police officers, Derek Hahn and Minh-Hung “Bobby” Nguyen, in June 2019 for trying to execute the Puana frame job and cover-up.

The Kealohas were charged separately for their financial misdeeds, which included accusations that Katherine Kealoha had stolen nearly $160,000 from two children while she was their court-appointed guardian.

Katherine Kealoha was also charged with a series of crimes stemming from allegations she and her brother were running a prescription drug ring and that she used her position as a prosecutor to keep their criminal activity hidden from law enforcement.

Everyone Was Culpable
Monday’s sentencing hearing, which included all three cases, was delayed numerous times due in large part to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

In a handwritten letter to Seabright, Kealoha pleaded for leniency, saying that her addiction to painkillers had clouded her judgment and that she was sorry for the pain she had caused.

The Kealohas and their co-defendants are the first to be prosecuted and sentenced as part of a years-long U.S. Justice Department investigation into public corruption and abuse of power in Hawaii government.

Several other high-profile officials, including Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro and former Corporation Counsel Donna Leong have been notified that they are targets of the ongoing criminal probe.

Two Honolulu police officers and others involved in the FBI investigation have been convicted for less serious offenses. Hahn and Nguyen are scheduled for sentencing Tuesday.


Katherine Kealoha appeared in federal court and apologized for her crimes before she was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

Carley Shimizu
On Monday, when Kealoha appeared in court she was wearing a prison jumpsuit, which was issued to her after her bail was revoked last year and she was forced to remain in custody at the Federal Detention Center near the Honolulu airport.

Several members of the Puana family were present, including Gerard, when Kealoha again apologized for trying to frame him.

“My actions are my own and I truly am sorry for them,” Kealoha said. “I ask for forgiveness from my family and from my uncle for all the destruction and devastation that I caused.”

Seabright didn’t give Kealoha the sympathy she was looking for. Instead, he imposed a harsher sentence because she had “perverted justice over and over and over and over again.”

He spent much of Monday’s hearing recounting the evidence against Kealoha and her co-conspirators.

He said it was clear that the former prosecutor had built her wealth — or at least the perception of if — on the back of her elderly grandmother and that she was willing to do anything to protect herself from being caught, even if it meant locking up her own uncle.

Louis Kealoha and the Honolulu Police Department’s Criminal Intelligence Unit, where both Hahn and Nguyen worked, were just as culpable, he said, because there was no way Katherine Kealoha would have been able to do her “dirty work” without them.

“You framed your uncle for a crime that he didn’t commit,” Seabright said. “Let me say that again. You framed your uncle for a crime he never committed. And given that your husband was the chief of police, the task wasn’t difficult. That’s the shock of all this.”

‘He Was Not The Mastermind’
Louis Kealoha, who filed for divorce from Katherine after their guilty verdicts last year, arrived at court wearing an aloha shirt underneath his blue suit.

During his sentencing proceedings, he talked proudly of his 30 year career in law enforcement and said he never expected to find himself facing judgment for a crime he himself had committed.

“In an ordered society trust in public officials is paramount,” Kealoha said. “I have betrayed that trust and for that I am sorry.”

Cory Lum/Civil Beat
Kealoha and his defense lawyer, Rustam Barbee, also did their best to distance the former police chief from his estranged wife. Barbee read a letter from Kealoha’s mother, Beatrice, in which she said his “only weakness was being truly dedicated to his marriage vows” and that he put too much faith in his wife.

“He was not the mastermind behind these offenses,” Barbee said. “Katherine Kealoha did much of these misdeeds and crimes unknown to him.”

Seabright, a former prosecutor who specialized in white collar crime and public corruption, didn’t buy it. He spent much of his time scolding Kealoha while pointing out the many ways in which he was a necessary part of the conspiracy to frame Puana.

The Criminal Intelligence Unit that conducted 24-hour surveillance on Puana in the lead up to his arrest reported directly to Kealoha, and many of its members, if not all, were handpicked by him.

Seabright also pointed out the fact that Kealoha lied in federal court when he was on the witness stand and asked to identify who he saw in a security video stealing his mailbox. Kealoha said it was Puana despite the fact the man in the video clearly was not Gerard Puana.

“I agree that Katherine was the mastermind behind this,” Seabright said. “But you were right there by her side, right there by her side cheering her on in your position as chief to aid the criminal enterprise that you helped establish.”

Kealoha will not have to report to prison until April 21. Outside of the courthouse, he addressed the media to thank his supporters and said he respected the court’s decision.

A Final Say
Florence Puana died in February at the age of 100, but she still had an opportunity to address the court.

Her daughter Charlotte Mallot, who is Gerard Puana’s sister, spoke at the hearing and read a letter that Florence wrote to Kealoha, her granddaughter, before she died.

Florence Puana said she trusted Kealoha and that she felt betrayed when she was forced to sell her home after Kealoha had tricked her into securing a reverse mortgage and stole much of the money. After filing the lawsuit, she said, the situation worsened and the acrimony ramped up.

“I was humiliated, frustrated and depressed when in retaliation you initiated conservatorship proceedings falsely challenging my mental stability and ability to care for myself,” Florence Puana wrote.

Gerard Puana speaks to media about the Katherine Kealoha sentencing.
Gerard Puana spoke to media outside the courthouse about the sentencing.

“Throughout the civil trial you manipulated and deceived the court and jury. The combined stress and unthinkable outcome of that trial left me stunned and totally shattered.”

Florence Puana told Kealoha that her actions divided a once close family, and that over the course of nearly a decade she had yet to receive an apology.

“It is now time to own up and ask forgiveness from your God for your offenses and for the anguish, pain and chaos you created in so many, many lives,” she said.

Gerard Puana also addressed the court through a letter read aloud by his attorney Eric Seitz, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Kealohas and the city on his behalf. Seitz said his client suffers from severe depression and anxiety after what happened to him, which is one of the reasons he did not want to speak on his own.

“To this day I flinch whenever I see a police car or notice a nearby car or truck and wonder if I’m being followed all over again,” Gerard Puana wrote.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wheat, who was assigned to investigate the Kealohas out of his office in San Diego, gave brief remarks to the media after the couple was sentenced.

Wheat said the fact that the Kealohas are headed to prison closes just one chapter in the ongoing criminal saga, and that for him and his team, “Our work continues.”",am,https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/11/former-honolulu-prosecutor-katherine-kealoha-sentenced-to-13-years-in-prison/

Wellington-raised corporate raider Sir Ron Brierley has been charged with eight more counts of possessing child-abuse material.

Brierley, 83, was detained by Australian Border Force officials while attempting to board a flight from Sydney to Fiji in December 2019. Detectives seized his carry-on bags, laptop and electronic-storage units and allegedly discovered more than 200,000 images and 512 videos.

He was subsequently charged with six counts of possessing child-abuse material.

New South Wales courts have confirmed to Stuff that a further eight charges have been filed, bringing the total to 14. Each charge carries a maximum jail term of 10 years.

Brierley, who lives in Sydney, remains on bail and is due to appear via video link again on December 10 in what appears to be a procedural hearing set down to take just five minutes.

He appeared in the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney in February, looking frail and walking with the help of a cane, The Sydney Morning Herald reported at the time.

His defence lawyer, Penny Musgrave, then told the court Brierley was intending to plead not guilty to the charges against him but a plea was yet to be formally entered. Australian courts on Tuesday said pleas had still not been entered.

The investigation into the recently retired Brierley was prompted by an anonymous tip to New South Wales police in August 2019.

Brierley was knighted in New Zealand in 1988, and was known as a “corporate raider” for his business activities involving a series of takeovers and mergers in the 1980s.

He launched into business while still a schoolboy at Wellington College in the early 1950s, operating The Kiwi Stamp Company during lunchtime from his desk, a biography from the Wellington Gold Awards says.

But his first real foray into investing came when he began publishing a sharemarket tip sheet, New Zealand Stocks and Shares, ultimately leading him to form R A Brierley Investments in 1961.

Twenty years later, Brierley Investments was a top 20 company on the New Zealand stockmarket and by 1984 was the most valuable company on the market.

Brierley remained in active control of Brierley Investments until 1990, but continued as chairman of Guinness Peat Group, which was renamed Coats in 2015. The company announced in 2016 that it would delist from the New Zealand stock exchange.",am,https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/123493833/sir-ron-brierley-facing-eight-more-charges-of-possessing-childabuse-material
"Federal agent who taught financial crimes course hid $250K in taxable income, lied to pay informant nearly $100K: feds","The Naperville man meticulously deposited the money into a bank account in small increments in order to avoid detection, the charges allege.

A Department of Homeland Security agent trained in financial investigations allegedly tried to hide $250,000 of income from his tax returns, while also lying in order to pay an informant nearly $100,000, prosecutors said.

A federal indictment doesn’t say where Anthony Sabaini received the money he allegedly omitted from his tax forms, but it claims he meticulously deposited the money into a bank account in order to avoid detection.

Sabaini, of Naperville, deposited the money to a bank account in increments under $10,000 more than 160 times from April 2014 to November 2018 to avoid federal reporting laws, the indictment states.

And then, over the next five years, Sabaini, 38, knowingly left that deposited cash off his tax forms, prosecutors said.

In 2014, he claimed an income of $113,000, when he allegedly knew his income exceeded that. His next four years of tax forms allegedly left out the extra income as well, the indictment states.

While the alleged tax fraud was happening, prosecutors say Sabaini also lied to his bosses in order to hire a confidential informant and pay him tens of thousands of dollars of federal money.

It’s unclear in the indictment if the $95,000 in payment he secured for the confidential drug informant is related to the tax charges, but the indictment states Sabaini repeatedly lied on forms, falsely claiming the informant had no criminal history.

In 2017, Sabaini told a DEA agent not to pursue charges against someone caught selling cocaine to an undercover agent, the indictment says. Sabaini claimed the person selling cocaine was a former informant of his, and that the person was involved in a larger investigation, the indictment states.

Several months later, Sabaini went to his bosses for permission pay his former informant several thousand dollars in order to use him for a new investigation, the indictment states.

But on a form asking Sabaini if the informant had been involved in a previous crime, he allegedly failed to mention the earlier drug deal when the informant sold drugs to the undercover informant. The indictment doesn’t mention a motivation behind the alleged false filing.

Sabaini is charged with five counts of filing a false federal tax return, one count of structuring a currency transaction and one count of willfully engaging in a scheme to conceal a material fact in a matter within the jurisdiction of DHS.

Sabaini was employed by the DHS as a special agent assigned to its office in Oakbrook Terrace, according to an indictment. He investigated narcotics and money laundering, and served as a lead instructor for a training course on money laundering and financial investigations.

His arraignment hasn’t been scheduled.",am,https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/11/19/21575594/homeland-security-administration-investigations-anthony-sabaini-charges-tax-drug-informant-dhs
Tanzania jails 2 Iranians over drug smuggling,"30-year jail terms handed to each convict

Two Iranian nationals were sentenced to 30 years in jail each in Tanzania for smuggling a big consignment of illicit drugs using a wooden dhow.

Nabibaksh Pribaksh Bidae, the captain of the seized ark, and his assistant Mohamed Hanif, were convicted of two offences of trafficking 111.02kg of heroin and 235.78 grams of cannabis resin.

The east African country, previously seen as a conduit for drug trafficking had in 2017 launched a massive drive against narcotics to quell growing criticism on its minimal capacity to intercept record-size drug hauls that often slipped-through its porous borders, raising fears about the country’s weak maritime surveillance.

Imakulata Banzi, the judge of the High Court of Tanzania (Corruption & Economic Crimes Division), delivered the verdict after the prosecution provided sufficient evidence that the duo had committed the crime.

The judge ordered the duo to spend 30 years in jail for each offence, instructing that the sentence would run concurrently.

The judge also asked the authorities to obliterate the seized drug consignment, as well as confiscating the ark the traffickers had used to sneak into the country.

She acquitted 11 other accused -- including eight Iranian personnel and three Tanzanians -- who were jointly charged in the trial.

As a conduit for heroin smuggling, criminals have for years been using loopholes and circuitous routes across east Africa to dodge authorities and import drugs from Afghanistan and other destinations as they desperately try to smuggle them to Europe.

Local and international media reports suggest that heroin coming from Afghanistan has been passing through Pakistan's southwest coast, and then taken by motorized wooden dhows to the east African coast.

Strict measures by Tanzanian government under President John Pombe Magufuli have led to the arrests of dozens of smugglers in a series of raids and clandestine operations in the capital Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Tanga, seizing hundreds of kilos of heroine.

Customs officials at Dar es Salaam port have repeatedly intercepted shipping containers concealing illicit drugs.

Prior to sentencing, the prosecution had asked the court to mete out severe sentence bearing in mind the gravity of the offence and the effects it has on the wider society and to human life.

The convicted persons and their accomplices were arrested on Oct. 24, 2017 on the Tanzanian territorial waters in the Indian Ocean by the authorities with the consignment of drugs.",am,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/tanzania-jails-2-iranians-over-drug-smuggling/2037123
Snohomish County Jail employee charged in drug smuggling,"Alexis Wafstet was charged with drug possession. Several inmates were allegedly in on the plot.

EVERETT — A Snohomish County Jail employee claimed she was threatened into smuggling drugs for inmates, according to new charging papers.

Alexis Wafstet, 45, a classification specialist tasked with deciding housing situations for those behind bars, was charged last week in Snohomish County Superior Court with possession of a controlled substance with no prescription.

Deputy prosecutor Elliott Thomsen, who wrote the charges, didn’t object to her staying released from jail while she awaits trial, so long as she attends her court hearings. She was on paid administrative leave this week pending an internal investigation.

Detectives with the Snohomish Regional Drug Task Force reviewed hours of calls, video chats and messages coming from the jail. The investigation found six inmates were talking to the same people outside the jail and appeared to be getting drugs from a jail employee. On May 12, at least two of those inmates were found hiding buprenorphine.

While reviewing phone calls made in Spanish, a corrections deputy heard references to an “older lady” who worked as a counselor at the jail and lived nearby. The deputy also listened to a phone call in which an inmate asked for an update on “presents” that were supposed to arrive.

The same corrections deputy recalled that Wafstet lived nearby and that he once gave her a ride to work during a snowstorm.

When detectives interviewed Wafstet, she at first claimed not to know anything about drugs being smuggled into the jail, according to the charges.

Wafstet reported she assisted one of the inmates allegedly involved in the plot with paperwork and with reaching his runaway daughter. She went so far as to meet his ex-girlfriend and daughter at a 7-Eleven near the jail while off-duty. She reported she knew such a meeting was against policy and that she never told management. According to charging papers, Wafstet said she had a similar childhood to the daughter and felt she could help.

Wafstet also reported she recently was threatened by a man. He wore a blue bandana over his face and showed her a picture of her 24-year-old son, she said. He gave her a note, threatening that she had to do what they said or her son could be hurt, according to her account. Wafstet later reported meeting with a man at the QFC by her house. He gave her something — what she assumed to be drugs — wrapped in a nitrile rubber glove, and was told to give it to the inmate she had been helping.

She gave the package to the inmate on Mother’s Day, she reportedly told detectives. He later returned it, saying it wasn’t what he wanted, according to charges. Wafstet also said she brought the inmate another package on a different day but didn’t know what was inside, according to the charges.

At her home, Wafstet showed detectives an egg-shaped item wrapped tightly in pieces of a glove and cellophane — packaging “consistent with that used by someone who would smuggle illegal substances internally,” Thomsen wrote. Inside was a strip of the opioid medication buprenorphine, 3.8 grams of a tar-like substance that tested positive for heroin and unidentified crushed orange pills.

Wafstet gave detectives a piece of paper with the threatening note that reportedly was left by the man who showed up at her house. She believes the note’s handwriting belonged to the inmate she was assisting. Charging papers did not describe what was written.

Detectives took Wafstet’s phone and received a judge’s permission to search it. Prosecutors noted that there were messages exchanged with two other suspects.

Prosecutors noted the defendant had no previous criminal history.

At the time of her arrest, the sheriff’s office indicated Wafstet could face more charges, depending on the outcome of the investigation.",am,https://www.heraldnet.com/news/snohomish-county-jail-employee-charged-in-drug-smuggling/
The Family: New details emerge about alleged leader of 500-person organized crime network in Calgary,"Lawrence Orubor has been charged with drug trafficking and organized crime-related offences. Police allege he led The Family, a gang of dealers who sold small quantities to mainly homeless drug addicts. (Facebook)
The man alleged to lead a 500-person criminal organization involved in selling drugs and terrorizing a vulnerable community with violence, including a homicide, was once called a career criminal with a horrendous record by a Calgary judge.

New details about massive drug distribution network The Family and alleged leader Lawrence Orubor have been uncovered by CBC News through court documents, online records, and interviews with people who are either close to the investigation or work with clients of the Calgary Drop-In Centre, where much of the criminal activity took place.

Since Orubor's arrest, staff at the DI, as well as police, have recorded a ""notable decrease of violent incidents"" in the downtown area, police say. 

Orubor, 52, who lives in Calgary's suburbs, has a criminal history dating back more than 30 years in both B.C. and Alberta, with at least 40 convictions on his record.

He now faces seven new charges connected to Operation Bloodline, the six-month police investigation into The Family. 

Two weeks ago, he was released on bail.

Homicide connection
The charges faced by Orubor are rare: instructing drug trafficking and violent offences for a criminal organization.

""[Those charges] requires a great deal of investigative rigour to put that before the courts,"" said Deputy Chief Chad Tawfik at Tuesday's police commission meeting.

If the violence hadn't gotten so intense, perhaps The Family would still be operating under the radar, selling mostly single doses of drugs to addicted, homeless Calgarians.

For months, The Family was responsible for the ""vast majority of violence in the downtown core"" according to Tawfik, who said the group is also implicated in a homicide. 

CPS wouldn't confirm which homicide was connected to The Family because it speaks to the evidence before the courts but a spokesperson for the service said charges have been laid in connection with the killing.


As part of Operation Bloodline, police worked with the vulnerable, drug-addicted population who'd become caught up with the organized crime group The Family. (CPS)
Police break up drug-trafficking ring called The Family that used vulnerable Calgarians as distributers
'Made his whole living off $20 rocks'
Orubor has at least three aliases and a 30-year history of criminal activity in both Lower Mainland, British Columbia, and Calgary, according to court records. 

""He's the guy that preys on the down-and-outs,"" said one CPS officer, whom CBC is not identifying because he's not authorized to speak on the matter. 

""He's made his whole living off $20 to $40 rocks.""

Another officer who investigated Orubor more than a decade ago, when he was under investigation by CPS for similar allegations, said Orubor targets underlings who are willing to ""work just for the dope"" and that he ""makes big money"" off of the system.

While several arrests tied to The Family were made in early November, investigators didn't simply target everyone buying and selling drugs.

There were different tiers of sellers, some who did it to support their own habit, and others who were more predatory, willing to commit acts of violence on behalf of the gang.

Calgary police tried to differentiate between the two, working closely with social services to line up supports for those victimized by The Family rather than charging everyone involved.

Orubor a 'career criminal', judge says
Court records show Orubor's criminal history dates back to the 1990s, although there appears to be a break in convictions since 2005.

In the 1990s, Orubor faced several sets of charges in B.C., including in Chilliwack, Surrey and New Westminster.

He was jailed in that province for drug trafficking, using counterfeit money, fraud and possessing a stolen credit card. 

In 2007, a Calgary judge called Orubor a ""career criminal"" with a ""horrendous"" record including more than 40 convictions, some of which were for violent offences like aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.

At the time, Orubor had unsuccessfully appealed a sentence of one year in jail after he was convicted of dangerous driving for speeding through a playground zone at 60 km/h, blowing through a stop sign, T-boning car and causing the other driver, who was battling cancer at the time, to suffer serious injuries including multiple rib fractures.

No contact order with convicted killer
Search warrants were executed in early November on two vehicles and four homes, one of which court records show is Orubor's.

In those raids, police say they seized thousands of grams of drugs including meth, fentanyl, crack and GHB.

At the time, Staff Sgt. Jody Gash said the drugs were distributed in small quantities ""across this vast network, never staying in one place for long.""

Two weeks ago, provincial court Judge John Bascom granted Orubor bail, allowing him to return to his southeast home with conditions including that he abide by an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and surrender his passport.

Orubor has retained defence lawyer Dick Cairns, a senior, well-respected lawyer who practises in both British Columbia and Alberta and has represented high-profile alleged gangsters including members of the Hells Angels and alleged FOB gang leader Nick Chan, whom he successfully defended in 2016 against charges of first-degree murder and instructing a criminal organization.

Other bail conditions include a no-contact order with 20 people, some of whom are listed in court documents as alleged co-conspirators and many who have faced prior charges related to violent offences, including Natalie Pasqua, who was previously convicted of manslaughter.

Orubor is also banned from going near the DI or the Sheldon Chumir, the location of a supervised injection site.

Police operation made 'huge difference' to DI safety
Staff at the DI say after the arrests, violence is noticeably down. Everyone from staff to clients feels safer. 

""It's such a huge difference, such a huge difference,"" says Elise, who works at the DI. CBC News has agreed to only identify her by her first name.

She said The Family's set-up on Dermot Baldwin Way, outside the DI, was predatory. 

""By hanging out outside … they were fully taking advantage of people who are dealing with dependency issues on drugs and alcohol and they were targeting them,"" says Elise.

She says the violence got so bad, some clients would ask to be let out the north doors rather than the ones leading to Dermot Baldwin Way.

CBC News contacted both Cairns and the prosecutor assigned to the case. Both declined to comment as the matter is still before the courts.

Orubor will be back in court this month. ",am,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/the-family-calgary-police-charges-drugs-drop-in-gang-1.5823960
Turkish mafia boss Çakıcı released,"Notorious Turkish mafia boss Alaattin Çakıcı was released on Thursday as a result of a new law designed to free as many as 90,000 inmates early to ease the spread of the coronavirus in overcrowded prisons, Artı Gerçek news site reported.

Çakıcı was convicted of establishing and leading a criminal organisation, ordering a murder, instigating assault and insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, each of which carries a lengthy prison sentence.

He was a prominent name in the 1980s as a crime boss and indicted in 1995 for contracting the killing of his wife in front of their son before fleeing abroad. Following his 1998 extradition from France, Çakıcı was released from prison in 2002. In 2004, Çakıcı was extradited again, this time from Austria, and has been in prison since then.

The ruling Justice and Development Party stepped up efforts to reduce the population in Turkey's overcrowded prisons as part of measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Turkey's parliament approved the law on Tuesday.

Opposition parties opposed the bill because it excludes tens of thousands of people in jail on terrorism charges, many of them for criticising the government, rather than carrying out acts of violence.",am,https://ahvalnews.com/amnesty-bill/turkish-mafia-boss-cakici-released
"Texas DPS arrests 17 in El Paso crystal meth, gang investigation","Multi-agency effort targets Interstate Mafia, Artistas Asesinos gangs
DANIEL BORUNDA | EL PASO TIMES
Show Caption
Parking lot crystal meth deals and a gun seizure on Interstate 10 were part of a nine-month Texas Department of Public Safety drug and gang investigation in El Paso.

The long-term, multiagency cases resulted in 17 arrests linked to the sale and possession of crystal methamphetamine and heroin, firearm charges and vehicles stolen in Lubbock transported to El Paso, said Lt. Elizabeth Carter, a DPS spokeswoman.

Most of the arrests went down at the end of October, although some of the crimes charged occurred months earlier, according to El Paso County Jail records. 

Seven women and 10 men, including two from Lubbock, were among the people arrested, DPS officials said.

DPS special agents worked with the state highway patrol, U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and the El Paso Police Department.

The investigation initially targeted members and associates of the Interstate Mafia and Artistas Asesinos gangs, DPS officials said.

Artistas Asesinos (Artist Assassins) originated as a graffiti tagging crew in Juárez before becoming a street gang allied with the Sinaloa cartel a decade ago in the Mexican border city. Historically, the gang has not had a major presence in El Paso.

DPS officials said Interstate Mafia, or ISM, is a newly formed street gang based in Texas.

Three Interstate Mafia members and three members of the Artistas Asesinos were arrested in various busts linked to the investigation, Carter said.

Gang-related meth case
One of the cases involved street sales of crystal meth in Horizon City involving at least one alleged Interstate Mafia member.

In July, Homeland Security Investigations Gang Unit special agents and the Texas DPS began an investigation into drug distribution and smuggling by the Interstate Mafia gang in the El Paso area, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by an HSI agent.

The BMW allegedly belonged to Smith and was being driven by his girlfriend, Jajaira Marie Alvarado, 30, of Las Cruces, as the couple was heading to the Outlet Shoppes at El Paso mall, according to the complaint. The pair are not listed as gang members in the complaint.

The document states that Alvarado told troopers she and Smith had been dating since May and that she didn't know about the guns. She was wanted on a New Mexico warrant on a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. She was arrested and jailed in El Paso before being handed over to another agency on the warrant.

HSI arrested Smith, 41, on a new federal charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded not guilty and is being held at the El Paso County Jail Annex without bond pending trial.

Overall, the multiagency DPS investigation resulted in the seizure of 15 weapons, four vehicles, various drugs and cash, officials said. The investigation continues.

The resignation is related to Lundborg being investigated for insider crime by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, with Kindred noting that it ‘does not have further information at this time and is fully cooperating with the public prosecutor and the SECA in their investigations’.

The group adds that additional information will be provided to the market when required, however no further comments will be given as long as the investigation is ongoing. 

“The resignation of Stefan Lundborg was unavoidable considering the investigation against him by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority,” Anders Ström, noted chairman of the board at Kindred Group.

Two people indicted on fraud charges in Optimus fraud case,"SEOUL, Dec. 4 (Yonhap) -- The prosecution on Friday indicted a key broker on charges of fraud in connection with its investigation into a financial fraud scheme at a private equity investment company.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office charged the suspect, only identified by his family name Shin, with fraud in the massive fund scam case surrounding Optimus Asset Management.

It also charged another suspect, surnamed Kim, with violation of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

The Optimus scandal centers on allegations that the private equity company solicited funds worth about 1.2 trillion won (US$1.08 billion) from thousands of people for investments in public institutions but actually funneled most of the money into risky assets, causing huge losses to the investors.

He also allegedly gave 650 million won in bribes to the representative of Haeduk Powerway's minority shareholders in return for voting rights.

The other suspect surnamed Kim is accused of colluding with Shin to take 20 million won in May from the Optimus CEO, which they had promised to hand to a former official at the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) before the financial firm suspended withdrawals from its funds in June due to liquidity issues.

Meanwhile, the investigators have been chasing yet another suspect, surnamed Ki, who is at large.

US lawyer charged with plot to steal Somali government funds,"COLLEGE PARK, US: A Maryland attorney has been indicted on charges he engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $12.5 million in Somali government assets from financial institutions and was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by a law firm that kept more than $3 million of the money.
A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted Jeremy Wyeth Schulman, 45, of Bethesda, on charges including wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and money laundering.
Schulman and others tried to fraudulently obtain control over hundreds of millions of dollars in Central Bank of Somalia assets held in bank accounts that had been frozen due to civil war and political instability in the African country, the 11-count indictment says.
Schulman presented banks with forged and falsified documents to fraudulently gain control of millions of dollars in Somali government assets between 2010 to 2014, the indictment says. It also says Schulman personally received hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation from the law firm that improperly retained $3.3 million of the Somali assets for fees and expenses.

Paul Butler, one of Schulman’s attorneys, said in a statement that they believe US Justice Department prosecutors are “misinformed” and failed to thoroughly investigate and identify “all exculpatory evidence.”
“We are confident that when permitted an opportunity to tell his story, Mr. Schulman will be wholly vindicated of any criminal conduct, let alone fraud,” Butler said.
The law firm that retained the money isn’t named in the indictment.
Schulman currently serves as a managing member of Schulman Bhattacharya and chairs the law firm’s commercial litigation and arbitration group. The firm’s website says Schulman has represented the Federal Republic of Somalia in “various matters, including conducting an investigation of financial corruption allegations asserted by the United Nations Monitoring Group for Somalia and Eritrea.”
Schulman is scheduled to make his initial court appearance on Monday before a federal magistrate judge in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Butler said the Transitional Federal Government of the Republic of Somalia “engaged” his client to assist it in recovering assets frozen overseas, including in the US The US government doesn’t dispute that more than $9 million in assets were returned to the Somali Central Bank, according to the defense lawyer.
“For more than four years, Mr. Schulman and his team worked tirelessly to assist a nation desperately in need of financial resources to ensure the government’s recovery from nearly two-decades of civil war. Over that time, Mr. Schulman has endeared himself as a trusted adviser and advocate of the Somali people,” Butler said.",am,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1772261/world
Bethesda attorney charged in $12.5M fraud scheme,"A Bethesda attorney has been charged with being part of a $12.5 million fraud scheme, in which authorities say he and others tried to take money and assets held on behalf of the Somali government.

Jeremy Schulman, 45, conspired with others from 2009 to 2014 to get financial assets on behalf of the Somali government, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland.

Schulman’s attorney, Paul Butler, of the Washington, D.C. firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, wrote in a statement to Bethesda Beat on Thursday that Schulman was working with Somalia’s Transitional Federal Government to help recover assets frozen overseas more than a decade ago.

“Specifically, Mr. Schulman was approached by the government’s last serving Central Bank Governor, who presented records documenting efforts taken to safeguard Somalia’s assets from falling into the hands of the warring parties,” Butler wrote. “For more than four years, Mr. Schulman and his team worked tirelessly to assist a nation desperately in need of financial resources to ensure the government’s recovery from nearly two-decades of civil war.”

The indictment states that Schulman and others created forged and fraudulent documents that misrepresented his ability to act on behalf of the Somali government to banks and other financial institutions.

Schulman, as well as co-conspirators and a law firm where he was a shareholder, took $12.5 million in frozen money, authorities said.

Schulman’s firm received $3.3 million and sent the rest of the money to the Somali government, according to the press release. Schulman also allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the firm and is accused of laundering money from the firm to the co-conspirators.

Butler wrote in his statement that the indictment doesn’t dispute the fact that more than $9 million was returned to Somalia’s central bank.

“Nor does the government dispute that Mr. Schulman repeatedly reaffirmed his authority to conduct asset recovery with the most senior of officials within the Somali government, including Transitional President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, former President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, as well as Finance Minister Sharif Hassan, among others,” Butler wrote.

Butler added that there is also no dispute that the funds were transferred according to State Department policy and the fees collected by Schulman’s firm were “contractually provided for pursuant to multiple engagement letters executed by senior Somali officials.”

“Rather, the government contends that Mr. Schulman improperly relied either on mis-translated Somali-language documents or the Somali language documents themselves,” Butler wrote.

Schulman has been charged with three counts of wire fraud, four counts of money laundering and one count each of mail and bank fraud. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison for each count of wire, mail and bank fraud, as well as up to 10 years in prison for each count of money laundering.

(Bloomberg) -- Next Digital Ltd. founder Jimmy Lai was taken into custody by Hong Kong police and charged with fraud, marking the outspoken pro-democracy media mogul’s latest run-in with the law as the city cracks down on high-profile dissidents.

Lai, 73, was charged with fraud alongside two Next Digital executives on Wednesday, according to Mark Simon, an aide to the media tycoon, confirming earlier media reports. Lai will probably be released on bail Thursday after a hearing, said Simon, who described the charges as being politically motivated.

Shares of Next Digital, which have been on a roller-coaster ride this year — they’ve hit record lows and 12-year highs in 2020 — were halted from trading in Hong Kong Thursday. They last traded at HK$0.23, down 10% for the year.

Lai’s arrest comes on the heels of another prominent activist, Joshua Wong, being sentenced for more than a year in jail for leading a protest outside of police headquarters last year. The moves represent the latest setbacks for the anti-Beijing movement that paralyzed the Asian financial hub last year. The turmoil prompted China to push through a national security law for the city, giving local authorities broad powers to silence critics.",am,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/hong-kong-media-mogul-jimmy-lai-detained-on-fraud-charges-1.1531003
"Rail Worker Accused of Overtime Fraud Made $461,000 in One Year","Five transit employees put in claims for ‘almost physically impossible’ shifts, a prosecutor said. That allowed them to outearn even New York’s governor.

Dec. 3, 2020
One night two years ago, Thomas Caputo, a senior track worker for the Long Island Rail Road, put in for 15 hours of overtime for work he said he had done at the West Side Yard in Manhattan. His shift began at 4 p.m. and ended at 7 o’clock the next morning.

But, the authorities say, Mr. Caputo was somewhere else that evening: at a bowling alley in Patchogue, N.Y., more than 55 miles away, where he bowled three games, averaging a score of 196.

He took home an overtime payment of $1,217, the government said.

Mr. Caputo was one of five current and former employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority charged on Thursday with participating in an overtime fraud scheme that allowed them to become among the highest-paid employees at the agency, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said.

The defendants, who worked at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit, frequently volunteered for lucrative overtime shifts and later claimed they had worked when they were in fact at home or other nonwork locations, or even on vacation, the prosecutors said.

Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the scheme involved claims for “extraordinary, almost physically impossible, amounts of overtime.”

Mr. Caputo, 56, who retired in 2019 after three decades with the railroad, was listed in 2018 as the highest paid M.T.A. employee with total pay of more than $461,000, including about $344,000 in overtime. All five defendants each earned more than the salary of the M.T.A. chairman or Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who oversees the agency.

A lawyer for Mr. Caputo did not respond to a message from a reporter seeking comment. Mr. Caputo had been the railroad’s chief measurement officer, leading a crew on a track geometry car that inspects the rails to identify areas that need repairs.

In 2018, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Caputo claimed to have worked 3,864 overtime hours, on top of 1,682 regular hours.

If he had worked every single day that year (which he did not), the complaint said, his claims would average about 10 hours of overtime each day for the entire year, beyond his regular 40-hour workweek.

Another defendant, Michael Gundersen, 42, a maintenance-of-way supervisor at New York City Transit, was accused of reporting he had worked long shifts in March 2018, for which he was paid $2,481. But evidence showed that at the same time, he had hotel reservations in Atlantic City and tickets for concerts there on successive nights, a second complaint charged.

During other periods that Mr. Gundersen was paid thousands of dollars for claimed overtime, he was on vacation in Williamsburg, Virginia, participating in a 5K footrace in New Jersey, and on a family vacation at a resort in the Hudson Valley, the complaint said. Mr. Gunderson’s lawyer declined to comment.

Mr. Caputo and the four other defendants each earned more than $348,000 total in 2018, the authorities said. The others ranked fourth, fifth, 11th and 12th that year in pay among all M.T.A. employees.

The charges come at a time when the authority is confronting its worst financial crisis because of the pandemic and a stalemate over federal aid. Without a financial bailout, the agency has said that it will have to slash subway and bus service and that more than 9,000 workers could lose their jobs.

In a news conference on Thursday in the State Capitol, Mr. Cuomo noted that the five individuals charged represented a tiny fraction of the M.T.A.’s work force, saying that there were “bad apples” in every profession. He said the M.T.A. needed to have systems in place to monitor its employees and their bills.

Still, he said, “You will never eradicate all bad actors in any system.”

The U.S. attorney’s office investigated the scheme with the F.B.I. and the transportation authority’s inspector general.

“This type of double-dealing directly contributes to rising M.T.A. fares for the average, hardworking commuter,” said William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the F.B.I.’s New York office.

Tim Minton, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said, “The alleged conduct by these M.T.A. employees is an egregious betrayal of public trust.”

He said the agency had undertaken aggressive overtime controls, which had resulted in a reduction of $105 million in overtime in 2019 alone.

The M.T.A. would “continue to root out waste, fraud and abuse wherever it occurs,” Mr. Minton said, “and will continue cooperating fully with this critically important investigation.”

The three other defendants were Joseph Ruzzo, 56, a retired Long Island Rail Road track foreman; and John Nugent, 50, and Joseph Balestra, 51, who are still working as track foremen.

Mr. Ruzzo’s lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Nugent’s lawyer, William Wexler, said his client denied “that he wrongfully obtained any monies from the rail road.” Mr. Balestra’s attorney, John LoTurco, said his client “vehemently denies all charges” and “adamantly asserts his innocence.”

The New York Times reported in May 2019 that the prosecutors had subpoenaed pay records for Mr. Caputo and more than a dozen other employees at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit.

The huge overtime payments made to Mr. Caputo and other M.T.A. employees were revealed a month earlier by the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Albany. Its research showed that 33 M.T.A. employees earned more than $300,000 in 2018, with almost all receiving large amounts of overtime pay.

Each defendant was charged with one count of federal program fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.

The charges come more than a decade after the Long Island Rail Road was caught up in a scandal over disability payments. A New York Times investigation had found that nearly every career employee who retired received a disability pension, even though many continued to lead active lives. More than 30 people — railroad workers, doctors and a union official — pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges.",am,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/nyregion/mta-overtime-fraud.html

"High-profile Gold Coast lawyer facing money laundering, drug charges","A colourful lawyer for bikies and strippers is in hot water himself, accused of laundering money for clients, as well as copping fraud and drug charges.

High-profile Gold Coast criminal lawyer Campbell MacCallum has appeared in a Brisbane court on a charge of possessing a dangerous drug.
A high-profile lawyer who represents bikies, strippers and rugby league players has been hit with criminal charges over accusations he laundered money for clients.

Campbell MacCallum, a founding partner of MMA Lawyers on the Gold Coast, is facing multiple charges following a 16-month major crime investigation conducted by the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC).

The charges laid against the 46-year-old include three counts of money laundering, two counts of fraud, two counts of supplying a dangerous drug and three counts of possessing a dangerous drug.

“It will be alleged the money laundering involved proceeds of serious criminal offences paid by clients for legal services undertaken by the firm,” the CCC said in a statement.

“It will be further alleged the fraud offences were committed against Legal Aid Queensland.”

Mr MacCallum was previously charged by the CCC with two counts of possessing a dangerous drug in July 2020.

The Gold Coast solicitor’s partner, 38-year-old Nicole Anne Crisp, was also charged with four counts of possessing a dangerous drug.

It comes after MacCallum’s home was raided in July as part of the investigation.

The couple are both expected to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on January 13.

CCC chairperson Alan MacSporran QC said allegations of criminal offending by individuals associated with the legal profession is concerning.

“In my view, any alleged criminal offending by individuals associated with the legal profession is very serious,” Mr MacSporran said.

“Legal Aid Queensland helps Queenslanders engage with the legal system. Any fraud on Legal Aid ultimately impacts on tax payers and those people who are financially disadvantaged that require access to their services.”

"Lebanon ex-army boss, intelligence heads charged with corruption","Eight former top security officers accused of ‘illicit enrichment’ among other charges, judicial sources say.

Beirut, Lebanon – A Lebanese judge has filed corruption charges against eight former high-ranking security officers, including an ex-army chief and the former top brass of army intelligence, two judicial sources familiar with the matter said.

The officers were formally accused of “committing the crime of illicit enrichment and exploiting their official positions to accrue vast fortunes and sums, by using their influence and accepting bribes”, one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.

They were also accused of “bringing officers into the Lebanese army in exchange for large sums of money and providing services to influential people in return for personal benefits”, the source said.

Those charged include former armed forces Commander General Jean Kahwaji, who held his post from 2008 till 2017, and ex-intelligence chiefs Edmond Fadl and Camille Daher, who were in office from 2008 till 2016 and 2016 till 2017, respectively.

High-level charges against a former army commander and intelligence heads are unprecedented in Lebanon, where corruption is notoriously prevalent but accountability is elusive.

The five others charged are the former head of Kahwaji’s office, Mohammad Jaafar al-Husseini, the former head of army intelligence in Beirut, George Khamis, the former head of army Intelligence in North Lebanon, Amer al-Hosn, retired Brigadier General Abdel-Rahman Shhaytli and a former officer in Lebanon’s General Security agency, Ahmad al-Jamal.

A Lebanese army spokesperson declined to comment. A General Security spokesperson said they had no information to provide. Al Jazeera was unable to reach the eight defendants.

Tried in civilian courts
The charges are based on preliminary investigations by Lebanon’s public prosecution office, which decided it had enough evidence to file public charges, the second judicial source told Al Jazeera.

The public prosecution relied among other things on information provided by politicians, written and visual media reports and other information on “large fortunes the defendants made during their time in office”.

The first judicial source said the judges’ suspicions were aroused by the “large number of properties and cars” owned by some of these individuals, in addition to the “large bank balances” they are reported to have – none of which could have been accrued with their state salaries or benefits alone, nor explained by family wealth.

Beirut Judge Ziad Abu Haidar filed the charges and transferred the case to Beirut Investigative Judge Charbel Abu Samra, who is tasked with setting a date for interrogating the former officers.

Under Lebanon’s Illicit Enrichment Law, the former security officers would be investigated and tried in civilian courts, rather than the Military Tribunal that is the usual avenue for cases involving security forces, the second source said.

Play Video
The case against seven former top army officers is a blow to the image of the Lebanese army, which is seen locally as one of the few state institutions that are not pervaded by fraud.

The army is largely funded by the United States and other Western nations, and Kahwaji himself received training in the US, the United Kingdom, Italy and Sweden.

The charges also raise the issue of malpractice in the country’s security institutions at a time when many are calling for security chiefs and other top officials to be held accountable for an explosion at Beirut’s port in August that killed 200, wounded more than 6,500 and wrecked large parts of the capital.

Judicial Investigator Fadi Sawan, the lead investigator in that case, has not filed charges against security chiefs despite them being aware of the presence of highly explosive material at the port for many years but failed to remove it.

Sawan has arrested 25 and charged 33 low- and medium-level administrative and security officials – many simply for their knowledge of the material’s presence.

The army is directly concerned with the disposal of explosive material.

Kahwaji was the armed forces commander from the time the material entered the port in late 2013 till he was replaced in 2017, but he has not been questioned by Sawan.

The first judicial source said Sawan had previously attempted to bring Kahwaji in for questioning, but the former army chief was travelling at the time.",am,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/2/lebanon-ex-army-boss-intelligence-heads-charged-with-corruption
UN agency hit with corruption allegations at climate projects,"United Nations Development Programme internal audit describes signs of fraud and collusion

The United Nations Development Programme is facing several allegations of fraud and corruption linked to the multibillion-dollar Global Environment Facility, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.

A copy of a draft report by UNDP’s office of audit and investigations, dated November 2020, described “financial misstatements” worth millions of dollars across UNDP’s portfolio of GEF-funded projects around the world.

The report highlighted problems including signs of “fraudulent activities” at two country offices and “suspicions of collusion among the various project managers” at another, without naming the countries.

“Issues identified by the audit could seriously compromise the achievement of the objectives of the audited entity,” the report said.

The GEF was set up in 1991 as part of the World Bank to help fight environmental challenges such as deforestation, species conservation and pollution. It has since split out to become an independent organisation and disbursed more than $21bn in 170 countries, including $7bn in projects managed by the UNDP.

The audit of the UNDP’s GEF-funded projects — which covers 2018 and 2019 and is the first review of its kind since 2013 — comes against a backdrop of rising concern from some donor countries over management and oversight issues at the UNDP.

An investigation by Foreign Policy in 2019 published whistleblower accounts alleging the misappropriation of millions of dollars at a UNDP-run GEF project in Russia. Twelve donor countries — including the US, France, Australia and Japan — have since sought an independent review of the UNDP’s handling of that project, according to a letter seen by the FT.

“Matters of misconduct and misappropriation of funds continue to obstruct sustainable development across the world,” the donors said in March in the letter to Achim Steiner, the UNDP administrator since 2017.

The words ‘climate’ and ‘corruption’, people see these as two different worlds, but there is a lot of overlap

Brice Böhmer, Transparency International
In a written response to the FT, the UNDP said it “takes all cases of financial mismanagement and other irregularities extremely seriously”, adding that its GEF projects were some of the organisation’s “most closely monitored”.

“The portfolio, the majority of which is implemented by national and subnational institutions, civil society organizations as well as other UN organizations, is subject to an intricate system of regular reviews, independent assessments and audits,” the UNDP said.

While there have been “allegations of misuse of funds” at certain projects, such complaints affected “a tiny fraction — 1.4 per cent” of the UNDP’s GEF-funded portfolio, it added. The GEF did not respond to a request to comment for this article.

Other project audits from independent consultants as well as written complaints from current and former UNDP staff, all seen by the FT, suggest that concerns over alleged financial misconduct and poor oversight at the UNDP may be widespread.

“What happened in Russia is a Russian problem. But things going wrong are very common,” said Frank Klinckenberg, a European environmental expert who has reviewed GEF programmes across the world for more than 10 years.

An independent review of a GEF-funded UNDP project in Uzbekistan, seen by the FT, warned that financial information provided by the UNDP was not reliable and “must be questioned”. “As a further result, this [midterm review] is required, by UNDP guidelines, to refer this project for a fraud investigation,” the draft report said.

UN-backed climate fund faces wave of abuse allegations from staff

According to another long-term external consultant to the UNDP, problems raised in project reviews frequently seemed to be ignored by senior staff.

“I don’t understand some of the management responses that have been made,” said the consultant, who asked not to be named. “We have an urgent climate crisis.”

The claims of misconduct at the UNDP are not the first allegations of impropriety linked to the UN’s climate work and represent one of the many challenges facing the UN as it seeks to co-ordinate a global response to climate change.

The UN-backed, South Korea-based, Green Climate Fund, the world’s largest climate finance institution, has faced a recent wave of internal misconduct complaints, including allegations of sexism and harassment in the workplace, the FT reported in August.

“The words ‘climate’ and ‘corruption’, people see these as two different worlds, but there is a lot of overlap,” said Brice Böhmer, the head of climate governance integrity at Transparency International, the global anti-corruption group.

Another person familiar with the allegations at the UNDP said there was a history of UNDP internal reviews avoiding “naming names”.

“No one is accountable, no one is responsible. The UNDP lets itself off the hook,” the person said, also asking not to be named. “These funds are intended for the poorest of the poor . . . at what point will donors [to the GEF] decide to suspend funding?”

Transparency International’s Mr Böhmer said governance at the GEF had improved in recent years, but noted that the GEF had limited authority over UNDP projects, which are implemented according to UNDP standards. Mr Böhmer has not seen the audit of the UNDP’s GEF projects reviewed by the FT and could not comment on its details.

“When it comes to climate, we need to have much higher standards,” he said. “If it is a project that is supposed to help an affected population adapt, then this is like penalising them twice.”",am,https://www.ft.com/content/054a529c-e793-489b-8986-b65d01672766
"Mohammed Nuru investigation: FBI visits San Francisco Department of Building Inspection, per multiple sources","From page 55 of the federal complaint vs. Public Works boss Mohammed Nuru
Multiple sources have confirmed to Mission Local that, at around mid-day Wednesday, FBI officials dropped in on San Francisco’s Department of Building Inspection. 

The feds allegedly entered the Planning Department, which is next door to the Department of Building Inspection headquarters on the 1600 block of Mission, and then migrated to an area where DBI stores servers. 

Mission Local is told that the federal officials were searching for files related to 555 Fulton St. That project is owned by Z&L Properties. Its billionaire co-owner, Zhang Li, purportedly lavished “some stone,” expensive liquor and seven-star accomodations on San Francisco Public Works boss Mohammed Nuru during a Chinese trip, according to the FBI. In exchange, Nuru purportedly pulled strings to help along the project. 

Nuru was last week arrested and charged with fraud related to this and other allegations of public corruption revealed in a long-running FBI probe. He was initially arrested on Jan. 21, but released after promising to cooperate with the probe and keep its existence secret. He allegedly did the opposite, however, and is charged with lying to the FBI about it. He faces up to 25 years in prison. 

Within the 75-page complaint against Nuru and restaurateur Nick Bovis unsealed last week, the disgraced Public Works head is caught on a federal wiretap purportedly going over a litany of issues he’d like to see remedied on the 555 Fulton project. 

Searching on city databases, it seems that there are no records for some of the work at 555 Fulton being described by Nuru in the federal wiretap — and, importantly, that other work appears to have approved “over the counter,” when far more extensive time and scrutiny should have been been applied. 

It is unclear if the feds today were able to locate the files they were purportedly seeking on DBI’s servers. 

Permitting on the 555 Fulton project was handled by deeply connected expediter Walter Wong. Wong’s offices were allegedly last month raided by FBI agents.

Our calls and messages to DBI have not been returned. The FBI refused to comment.

Update, Feb. 6: John Murray, a DBI spokesman, returned our call. He confirmed that visitors from the FBI dropped by the Department of Building Inspection on Wednesday.

“We intend to cooperate with the investigation.”

How long were they there? “No comment.”

Did they explain what they were looking for? “No comment.”

The Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog has expelled a former government official in China’s far western Xinjiang region for alleged corruption, according to state media.
Ren Hua, who was deputy chairwoman of Xinjiang’s regional government, has had her case handed over to the judicial body to prepare for trial, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website.
She “was found to have flouted the original aspirations and founding mission of the Communist Party of China and was disloyal to the party”, official news agency Xinhua reported on Monday, citing the commission.
“Ren reaped huge profits from illegal lending, taking advantage of … entities or individuals within her administration or service sphere,” the anti-corruption agency said, according to the report.
She also used her position “to seek benefits for others in terms of enterprise operation, project contracting and land transfer, and illegally accepted huge amounts of money and property in return”, it said.

A former New York-based Bank of America executive received tens of thousands of dollars at a time in cash bribes, federal prosecutors say, in exchange for fraudulently helping a New Jersey firm get a line of credit at the bank.

Kurt Phelps, the executive, was arrested Oct. 29 and charged with bank bribery and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Phelps’ arrest is a rare instance of an executive at a major U.S. bank arrested for their conduct as a banker.

Federal prosecutors accused Phelps of a bribery scheme in which he coached Starnet Business Solutions, a Mahwah, N.J. print shop, to falsify financial records to get a line of credit from Bank of America in exchange for cash. Phelps pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes over a number of years, prosecutors said.

According to a law-enforcement affidavit filed with the federal charges, Phelps told a co-conspirator that others inside the bank were involved in facilitating the scheme and receiving payoffs as well. No other bank employees appear to have been charged in the alleged bribery scheme, according to public records.

At the time of his arrest, Phelps was a New York City market executive for Bank of America Business Banking. That meant he was responsible for much of the bank’s lending to mid-sized businesses in America’s largest city.

Phelps’ employer was referred to only as “Victim Bank-1” in an October press release from New Jersey’s U.S. Attorney, but Bank of America confirmed Phelps’ identity and job title to The Charlotte Observer.

“Mr. Phelps has been fired and we are cooperating with the investigation,” said Bill Halldin, a spokesman for the bank. He declined to say whether other bank employees have been fired or placed on leave. Two people familiar with the situation said Bank of America has started an internal investigation into the case.

Three executives at Starnet pleaded guilty to crimes related to their roles in the scheme. They have yet to be sentenced.

Phelps’ lawyer, public defender Kevin Carlucci, did not respond to an Observer request for comment. Lawyers for Gary Swenson and John Scott Brink, Starnet executives who pleaded guilty, did not reply to requests for comment.

Kerry Lawrence, attorney for Starnet President Douglas Arbolino, who also pleaded guilty, said that “Mr. Phelps is the most culpable player in this conspiracy.”

The case is unusual for the how long the alleged scheme lasted — about six years — and for the seniority of the bank executive who was charged.

“You don’t see cases like this very often because there are safeguards. There are checks and balance in place,” said Dennis Lormel, a security consultant in Virginia who once served as chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s financial crimes program.

“To what extent was there maybe complicity? How good was this person at manipulating the system?” Lormel said of the scheme.

INSIDE THE SCHEME
Phelps coached the team at Starnet through the scheme, according to an FBI affidavit and court filings related to the others charged in the case.


Mainstream banks such as Bank of America have a high bar on the credit they give businesses. The banks want to make safe loans to businesses with established cash flows. Prosecutors said in filings that Phelps instructed Starnet on how to cook its books to make it look like one of those loans and get access to millions of dollars in credit.

Starnet got its first line of credit from Bank of America for $1.5 million “in or around 2013,” according to federal court filings prosecutors made in New Jersey in connection with the guilty pleas from Starnet executives. By 2018, that line had grown to $8 million.

To get that credit, executives sent inflated or false information about the firm’s finances to the bank, according to the filings. Phelps helped direct the fraud, they said, by reviewing draft information and giving feedback on how the executives should fudge the numbers.

In a 2017 text message exchange cited in an affidavit submitted by FBI agent Victor Hernandez, Phelps told a Starnet executive that the firm’s accounts receivable — money owed to Starnet — seemed a bit low.

“Should I raise it?” the executive texted Phelps.


Phelps replied: “If you can raise a bit would br (sic) better.... Up the receivable a bit.... Couple hundred thousands.”

DODGING AUDITS
One problem with the scheme: Bank of America, like all major banks, has teams of auditors and compliance staffers whose job it is to ferret out fraud. A close look at Starnet’s books might catch the goosed numbers.

The specific mechanics aren’t clear from the court filings, but Phelps says in texts cited in an FBI affidavit that he helped Starnet dodge the bank’s audits. Text messages cited by the FBI show Phelps telling a Starnet executive that another unnamed Bank of America employee had joined in on the scheme.


“Get me the finsncials (sic) and let me see what I can do with or (sic) friend” Phelps said in a text exchange from 2014. “I have an idea. But we need to get this done before he leave (sic). Especially the no audit thing. You know what I mean.”

Arbolino, Swenson and Brink pooled their cash to pay the bribes, which were hand-delivered in FedEx envelopes, the FBI and prosecutors allege.

Phelps also indicated in text messages that he was paying bribes to others inside the bank. In a text message exchange from 2014, the FBI’s Hernandez said, Phelps was referring to another bank employee when he wrote, “(A)ss clown wants 14... I said no. Got him to 10.” Hernandez said the numbers referred to a $10,000 bribe in connection with avoiding an audit.

The filings do not indicate whether any other Bank of America employees are under investigation. Phelps oversaw a team of 11 relationship managers, according to his LinkedIn page.

Phelps may have run a similar bribery scheme with other companies, according to texts Phelps sent that the FBI cited. In 2017, Phelps sent a Starnet executive saying “By the way this stuff ... is what has kept you and the other three clients in their current status.” Hernandez said that the “stuff” in question was bribes.


Matthew Reilly, a spokesman for New Jersey’s U.S. Attorney, said that the charges remain pending against Phelps, but declined to elaborate. “Not much else we can say at this point,” Reilly said. Starnet’s line of credit came due in 2019, according to prosecutors’ filings. It has not been repaid.

To Lormel, the security consultant, the biggest unanswered question is the true scale of the bribery.

“If there’s any credibility about him being able to bribe other people in the bank, that’s a much broader problem,” Lormel said. “The regulators are going to need to determine if this is a one-off situation.”",am,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/banking/article247407835.html
Illegal alien from Mexico indicted for attempted federal bribery,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Jesus Christian Miranda-Alcantar, 33, an illegal alien from Mexico, has been charged in a federal indictment with attempted bribery of a federal officer and illegal reentry following deportation from the United States.

The announcement was made by United States Attorney Mike Hurst, Gilbert Trill, Acting Special Agent in Charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations in New Orleans, and William Joyce, Acting Field Office Director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO).

The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury on November 17, 2020, charges Miranda-Alcantar with one count of attempted bribery of a federal officer and one count of illegal reentry to the United States following deportation.

In September 2020, Miranda-Alcantar was found in Hinds County, following his arrest on a domestic violence charge, present without necessary permission to be in the United States since ICE had removed him from the United States in 2013. While being transported to jail from immigration processing at the ERO offices in Pearl, Miranda-Alcantar offered to pay the federal officer transporting him a bribe of $8,000, if the officer would stop, let Miranda-Alcantar out of the vehicle by the side of the road, and let Miranda-Alcantar escape.

On December 1, 2020, Miranda-Alcantar appeared for arraignment on the indictment before United States Magistrate Judge Linda Anderson in Jackson. The Court ordered Miranda-Alcantar detained in U.S. Marshals custody while awaiting trial.

Miranda-Alcantar faces maximum penalties of 15 years in prison for the count charged for bribery, and two years in prison on the immigration charge. Each count also can merit a fine of up to $250,000.

Trial has been set for February 1, 2021, before U.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves in Jackson.

Third Cincinnati council member arrested on federal corruption charges,"P.G. Sittenfeld, 36, was once thought to have a bright political future, representing a new generation of leaders.

CINCINNATI -- The front-runner to be Cincinnati’s next mayor was arrested at home this week by federal agents for allegedly accepting $40,000 in bribes, casting his once-bright political future into doubt and further tainting a city council beset by corruption charges.

Alexander Sittenfeld, known as P.G., is charged with two counts each of honest services wire fraud, bribery and attempted extortion, federal prosecutors said.

He is the third member of Cincinnati’s nine-member council to be arrested this year on federal corruption charges.

Prosecutors said Sittenfeld’s arrest is related to a downtown development project that an undercover agent posing as a real estate investor wanted to get off the ground. Sittenfeld faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said.

Before his arrest, Sittenfeld, 36, represented a new generation of up-and-coming political leaders, said David Niven, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati.

“He had a clear path to the mayor’s office. He presented himself as the young, the next, and the newest and the best and the brightest in politics,” Niven said. “He offered what seemed like a new, cleaner politic but obviously the allegations are more of the old.”

As part of an alleged scheme to display his influence, Sittenfeld presented voting data to an undercover agent that showed his political popularity, federal prosecutors said.

Every successful developer and business leader in Cincinnati has “already placed their bets with me,” Sittenfeld, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2016, told undercover agents, according to the indictment. “I can move more votes than any other single person.”

Many of his council colleagues would not argue that point, although it may not matter anymore.

“It’s very sad. I’ve known P.G. and his family for years and I couldn’t be more shocked and stunned and disappointed,” said Councilman David Mann, a Democrat who twice served as mayor.

For his part, Sittenfeld said he is innocent of the charges.

“The allegations against me are simply not true,"" he tweeted Friday. ""The attempt to portray proper assistance to a project bringing jobs and growth to our city that benefits the public is a gross overreach and an injustice. I stand strongly on my record of public service.”

He did not return phone calls seeking further comment.

Sittenfeld’s arrest comes after former Councilwoman Tamaya Dennard, 40, a Democrat, pleaded guilty in June to honest services wire fraud.

In 2019, Dennard, a first-term councilwoman, allegedly engaged in acts and attempted acts of bribery and extortion while trying to exchange her votes for money, according to federal prosecutors.

She faces up to 20 years in prison and fines and restitution for allegedly requesting between $10,000 and $15,000 from an individual to pay for her expenses, NBC 5 in Cincinnati reported.

Months went by and City Hall was seemingly starting a new chapter when the page flipped to Republican Councilman Jeff Pastor, 36. Federal agents charged him last week with a 10-count indictment for bribery, extortion, money laundering and fraud.

Prosecutors claim he solicited and received $55,000 in bribes from August 2018 to February 2019 in exchange for promised official action related to projects before the council. Pastor pleaded not guilty.

“The city of Cincinnati has now been brought to its knees. We need drastic reform unlike anything we’ve ever seen in the history of this city,” Hamilton County Republican Chairman Alex Triantafilou tweeted. “The voters of this city must make serious changes in 2021, and they need to understand how truly broken City Hall has become.”

Sittenfeld was arrested after a federal grand jury charged him this week in a sealed indictment.

“Three out of nine of us are indicted, it’s insane. I’m glad it's getting solved and people are going down for it,” said Councilwoman Betsy Sundermann, a Republican. “I think he should resign. We can’t have him proposing legislation and voting on things if he took bribes.

“They (residents) don’t trust any of us, and I understand why they don’t trust any of us,"" she added. ""They think that government is dirty. It’s going to take a lot or rebuilding trying to fix this.”

Just three days before Sittenfeld’s arrest, Sundermann had announced plans to amend the city charter to allow for the removal of any council member charged with a felony or displaying unethical behavior.

“Our city charter does not have any provision in it to remove a council member for unethical behavior,” Sundermann said. “You can be a council member and get convicted of murdering 10 people and still not be kicked off city council. That’s a big problem.”

She said she needs 15,000 signatures to get the amendment proposal on the November 2021 ballot after she officially brings it before city council members.

Sittenfeld, a Democrat who graduated from Princeton University, was born and raised in Cincinnati. After college, he was awarded a Marshall Scholarship for graduate studies at Oxford University, according to his council member page on the city’s website. He is serving his third term.

After announcing his run for mayor, he was endorsed by unions and most community leaders and raised $700,000 for his campaign, making him the undisputed frontrunner in next year's election.

Federal officials allege Sittenfeld accepted eight checks totaling $40,000 dating back to 2018 in exchange for “specific action” in his role as a city official. He solicited and received the money through a federally regulated political action committee he organized and controlled in connection with the supposed development, federal officials said.

The payments, which he requested on multiple occasions, were for a downtown property the city of Cincinnati owned, which was later transferred to the Cincinnati Port Authority, prosecutors said.

An undercover agent acting as a real estate investor had wanted to develop the property for years, but could not move forward without council approval, according to the indictment.

In November and December 2018, Sittenfeld promised he could “deliver the votes” in city council to support a development project in exchange for four $5,000 contributions to his PAC, prosecutors said. He accepted the checks in September and October 2019, they said.

Over the next several months, Sittenfeld allegedly told the investors he would apply additional pressure to public officials relating to the development project.

Councilman Mann, 81, said the city prides itself on good government and was one of the first in the nation to adopt a city-manager form of government. Even the son of a U.S. president once served as mayor, Charles Taft, whose father was former President William Taft, he said.

Mann, the mayor of Cincinnati in 1981 and 1991, is running against Sittenfeld in next year’s mayoral race.

“All of us have to remember what this is supposed to be about, it’s serving the public and greater good, and how we went down this path I don’t know,"" Mann said. ""It’s inconsistent with the history of this community in my experience.”

Niven, the political science professor, said the slew of charges against council members may have caused residents to lose trust in those they once supported.

“There’s an enormous pressure on the remaining members of council,” Niven said. “The lesson that the community would rightly take is a cynical one. It almost doesn’t matter who you vote for, their service to you may not be honest. And that’s a sad conclusion.”",am,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/third-cincinnati-council-member-arrested-federal-corruption-charges-n1248449
S.F. city administrator steps away from job in light of public corruption probe,"Naomi Kelly said in a letter to Mayor London Breed on Wednesday that she is stepping down from her role as city administrator.

City Administrator Naomi Kelly stepping away from her job after getting linked to the U.S. Department of Justice's growing probe into public corruption in San Francisco.

Kelly, who has not been charged with a crime, attended a 2016 trip to China with her family that was allegedly paid for by permit expediter Walter Wong as a bribe for her husband, the San Francisco Examiner reported. Federal authorities also raided the her Inner Sunset home Monday after charging her husband Harlan Kelly with fraud for allegedly accepting bribes, including the trip.

""In light of recent events, I have decided to take a voluntary leave focus on my family and especially on my two children, who have been devastated by public accusations and public speculation based on the word of a liar,"" Naomi Kelly wrote in a letter to Mayor London Breed on Wednesday in reference to Wong.

Harlan Kelly is general manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and was charged by federal authorities Monday in connection with the wide-ranging public corruption investigation. He was charged with one count of honest services wire fraud for allegedly engaging in a bribery scheme and corrupt partnership with Wong, a San Francisco permit expeditor and construction company executive charged several months ago, federal prosecutors said.

The complaint filed Monday after a search warrant was served at the Kelly's home alleges that as part of the scheme, Wong provided items of value to Harlan Kelly in exchange for official acts by him that benefited or were intended to benefit Wong’s business ventures.

Naomi Kelly was first appointed to her position by former Mayor Ed Lee in 2012 and was reappointed to a five-year term in 2017.

Retailer charged with attempt to bribe police officer,"BY FIQAH ROSLAN ON DECEMBER 1, 2020, TUESDAY AT 4:57 PMSABAH

Sharif and Mujahid outside the court, waiting for their cases to be mentioned. 

KOTA KINABALU: A retailer was charged with attempting to bribe a police officer, while his supposed accomplice was charged separately for alleged abetting.

Sharif-ud-din, 39, was charged on two counts of attempting to bribe a police officer RM500 on two separate occasions. However, he denied committing the offences before Sessions Court judge Abu Bakar Manat.

In the first charge, Sharif had purportedly attempted to bribe a police officer with RM500 on March 23 this year, at one Shahid Enterprise. It was believed he had tried to bribe the officer who found untaxed cigarettes at the premises.

In the second charge, the accused was alleged to have committed the same offence involving a different officer, on April 22 at the same place. Both charges came under Section 17 (b) of the Malaysian Anti-corruption Commission (MACC) Act, punishable under Section 24 (1) of the same Act.

On conviction, Sharif could face up to 20 years in jail and a fine of no less than five times the amount bribed, or RM10,000, whichever is higher.

As for his alleged accomplice Mujahid Ali Aman Ullah, the 41-year-old retailer also pleaded not guilty to two charges of supposedly abetting the purported bribe on the same days.

For his cases, the charges fall under Section 28 (1) (c) of the MACC Act, read together with Section 17 (b), punishable under Section 24 (1) of the Act.

Upon conviction, Mujahid could face up to 20 years’ imprisonment and a fine of no less than five times the amount bribed, or RM10,000, whichever is more.

Both accused persons were released on bail of RM10,000 with RM7,000 to be deposited with one local surety, which in these cases were the accused’s wives.

The court also impounded the passports of both accused persons, with instruction to report to the MACC headquarters once a month, pending disposal of the case.

"Energy Trader Vitol Paying $163 Million to Settle Corruption, Manipulation Charges","Company accused of using bribes to gain advantage when bidding for oil in Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador

Vitol’s Justice Department deal is expected to be followed by similar settlements involving commodity trading companies.

Swiss-based energy firm Vitol agreed to pay $163 million to settle criminal and civil charges that its employees paid bribes to gain an advantage when bidding for oil in Brazil, Mexico and Ecuador.

Vitol’s deal with the Justice Department, announced Thursday in Brooklyn federal court, is the first in what is expected to be a series of similar settlements involving global commodity trading companies. Some of the claims grew out of a sweeping corruption scandal in Brazil that focused on bribery of officials at state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA, also known as Petrobras.

A private company that is one of the largest traders of crude oil in the world, Vitol said it cooperated extensively with authorities, yielding a settlement that is more lenient. “We understand the seriousness of this matter and are pleased it has been resolved,” chief executive officer Russell Hardy said in a statement.

The deal includes a deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, allowing Vitol to escape charges if it stays out of trouble for three years. The company will pay a $90 million fine to the DOJ and an additional $45 million in a coordinated settlement with Brazilian authorities, according to U.S. prosecutors.

Vitol, accused of paying millions in bribes over a decade, also settled a probe by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It will pay at least $28 million to the CFTC, a civil regulatory agency.

Vitol trades 8 million barrels a day of crude oil and manages upstream assets and refineries, according to its website. Other trading companies that have faced similar corruption investigations include Glencore PLC and Singapore-based Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.

Vitol admitted paying more than $8 million in bribes to at least nine Petrobras officials to get inside information that included weekly reports containing the oil company’s production volume and anticipated imports, as well as “last look” information that revealed confidential bids by competing companies, according to the settlements.

Traders used the information to determine the exact price they would need to bid to buy from Petrobras, a figure they sometimes called the “golden number.” They used aliases such as “Batman,” “Popeye” and “Beb.”

In Mexico and Ecuador, Vitol traders paid more than $2 million in bribes to officials at the state-owned oil Petróleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, and Petroecuador, prosecutors said. The scheme in those countries was ongoing as recently as July 2020, they said.

Brazilian prosecutors announced in 2018 that they were probing Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura for paying bribes that won them better terms on trading contracts. The authorities said bribes were paid to executives of Petrobras’s marketing and trading department and involved employees in the state-controlled oil producer’s Houston and Rio de Janeiro offices.

Following that announcement, Petrobras in 2018 temporarily suspended trading with the three companies.

A Glencore spokesman declined to comment. Glencore disclosed in August that it has spent $56 million in the first half of 2020 defending itself from various government investigations, including those undertaken by the DOJ, CFTC, U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office and Brazilian authorities.

A spokesperson for Trafigura said the company had responded to information requests from authorities and hired lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to investigate allegations of improper payments concerning Petrobras.

“Based on its review to date, which is ongoing, Quinn Emanuel believes any allegations that current management were involved in, or had knowledge of, alleged improper payments to Petrobras are unsupported by the evidence and untrue,” the spokesperson said.

In September, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed an indictment charging Javier Aguilar, a former Vitol manager and oil trader, with participating in a scheme to bribe Ecuadorean officials to secure a $300 million contract from the country’s state-owned oil company.

A lawyer for Mr. Aguilar said he denies the allegations.

Prosecutors have also recently unsealed years-old guilty pleas by a former Houston-based Petrobras official and a middleman who were involved in the Brazilian bribery schemes.

The CFTC’s involvement in a foreign-corruption case is novel. The CFTC typically regulates derivatives but announced in early 2019 that overseas corruption could violate laws it enforces.

France's former 'Bling-Bling President' Sarkozy in court on corruption charges,"The case has gripped France even as the country battles a deadly second wave of the coronavirus. 

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrives at the courtroom Monday, Nov. 30, 2020, in Paris. Sarkozy goes on trial on charges of corruption and influence-peddling in a phone-tapping scandal, a first for the 65-year-old politician who has faced several other judicial investigations since leaving office in 2012.

His nickname was the “Bling-Bling President” because of his fondness for expensive suits and lavish lifestyle. Now, former French leader Nicolas Sarkozy is in court facing allegations of corruption and influence-peddling.

If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in jail and a fine of almost $1.2 million. Sarkozy denies the charges, telling the criminal court in Paris on Monday: “I don't accept any of the slander that has been leveled at me over the past six years.”

He is the first French president in modern history to appear in court on corruption charges. The case has gripped France even as the country battles a deadly second wave of the coronavirus.

Pierre Haski, journalist and co-founder of French independent news website Rue89.com, describes public interest in the case as morbid fascination. To witness a once powerful individual having to stand in court, and confirm to a judge that his name is Nicolas Sarkozy, he said, is compelling viewing.

“We enjoy bringing down our heroes.”

Pierre Haski, Rue89.com, co-founder
“We enjoy bringing down our heroes” — after all, “the French cut the head off their king 200 years ago.”

The case, known as the “wiretapping affair,” alleges that Sarkozy attempted to bribe a judge, Gilbert Azibert, to hand over confidential information from another investigation into his presidential campaign. In return, Sarkozy is accused of offering the judge a cushy job in Monaco. The goings-on came to light after investigators placed wiretaps on Sarkozy’s phone as part of a separate inquiry into him: Investigators had been bugging conversations between Sarkozy and his lawyer, Thierry Herzog, since 2013, as they examined allegations of Libyan financing of the former president’s 2007 campaign. The job in Monaco never transpired but prosecutors claim Sarkozy’s promise to help Azibert constitutes a crime. Sarkozy, Herzog and Azibert are all on trial.

Supporters of the right-wing, former French leader say the case is evidence of a left-wing plot to destroy Sarkozy. They claim that liberal judges, whom Sarkozy frequently criticized while he was in office, are exacting their revenge. In a recent interview with French TV station BFMTV, Sarkozy said what he is being put through is a scandal.

But the former French leader has plenty of detractors. It was under his presidency that the “burqa ban” was introduced in France. French Algerian journalist Nabila Ramdani said Sarkozy stigmatized and criminalized the Muslim community in France with this legislation. Ramdani said the ban was superficially aimed at all head and face coverings, but it was clear who the main target was.

“The legislation was primarily aimed at putting Muslim women in their place and criminalizing the alleged males in their lives who were forcing them to cover their faces, effectively criminalizing anyone who looked Muslim.”

Nabila Ramdani, journalist
“The legislation was primarily aimed at putting Muslim women in their place and criminalizing the alleged males in their lives who were forcing them to cover their faces, effectively criminalizing anyone who looked Muslim,” she said.

It’s not just members of the Muslim community in France who hold the former president in contempt. Sarkozy’s love of the high life and his relationship with former Italian model Carla Bruni irritated many voters. Sarkozy married Bruni, his third wife, after winning the presidency in 2007.

Related: Who is responsible for migrant youth in France? 

Ramdani said the Bling-Bling President was seen by many as someone who glorified self-enrichment over society.

“The early days of his time in office were characterized by dinners with his billionaire friends, superyacht holidays and private jets,” she said.

It was an image that Sarkozy attempted to change when he put himself forward for reelection in advance of the 2017 presidential election, but he failed to even get through the primaries.

Today’s case is seen not only as a trial for Sarkozy but a test of France’s anti-corruption judges. Never before has a former president faced such a litany of allegations. One of the most serious is a claim that Sarkozy received illegal money from the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to fund his successful 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy denies the allegation.

Journalist Haski said this month’s case is being seen as a test of the French judicial system.

“In the end, we will see whether the judges have managed to pass real justice or whether the status of a president is still unreachable and with good lawyers, you can get away with anything,” Haski said.

Dr. Rabah Aissaoui, associate professor of French studies at the University of Leicester in Britain, said it would mark a major change in the political system in France if a former president were to be imprisoned for corruption. Up to now, French leaders have been largely protected by the system, he said.

Despite the allegations, Sarkozy remains hugely popular among conservatives in France.

Apollo rebuked in trial over bogus expenses,"US judge concludes private equity firm shares some of the responsibility for dealmaker’s expense scandal

A US federal judge has rebuked Apollo Global Management for practices that enabled a senior partner at the private equity firm to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors for personal expenses including a friend’s bachelor party and a trip to the Super Bowl.

In a blistering ruling, Judge Kevin Castel ordered the former executive, Mohammed “Ali” Rashid, to pay a $240,000 civil penalty for phoney expense claims that “operated as a fraud” on investors in Apollo’s private equity vehicles.

The judge also heaped blame on Apollo for directing private equity funds it managed for outside investors, who include many of America’s biggest public pension funds, “to pay the entirety” of the bogus expenses. “While Rashid lied on his expense reports and was recklessly indifferent about the source of his reimbursements,” Judge Castel wrote, “significant responsibility lies with Apollo.” 

The September judgment, which has not previously been reported, marks a setback to Apollo’s efforts to draw a line under a scandal that has festered for nearly a decade.

Apollo reported Mr Rashid’s bogus expenses to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013, three years after confronting the executive over earlier instances of inappropriate billings. In 2016, the firm reached a $52m settlement with the regulator after a wide-ranging investigation into its financial arrangements with private equity funds. The funds are largely owned by institutional investors but are managed by Apollo, which chooses buyout targets and oversees portfolio companies in exchange for an annual fee and a share of the profits when investments are ultimately sold.

The deal did not require Apollo to admit any wrongdoing, and enabled the group to avoid trial on allegations that included failing to properly supervise Mr Rashid, who had joined the firm in 2000 from Goldman Sachs, and specialised in finding deals among metal and mining companies. 

The fraud effected upon Apollo’s private equity funds also appears to be attributable in part to internal Apollo practices

Judge Kevin Castel
Mr Rashid was forced out of Apollo in 2014. He was not covered by the firm’s settlement with the SEC, and the regulator filed a civil complaint against the former dealmaker three years later. 

Upholding parts of that complaint, the New York court found that Mr Rashid had committed 32 violations of the Investment Advisors Act. But the judge also gave a more expansive description of Apollo’s responsibility than the one put forward in the SEC settlement, stating that “the fraud effected upon Apollo’s private equity funds also appears to be attributable in part to internal Apollo practices that were unknown to Rashid”.

During a nine-day trial in New York which concluded in January, regulators detailed dozens of occasions when Mr Rashid submitted “business” expenses claims that Apollo later identified as personal. He ultimately paid back $290,000 to the Apollo funds, although the SEC case only involved a portion of those charges, and the evidence suggests that the Stanford-educated financier paid back more than he improperly received.

Any hope that he would win back his job proved futile. Mr Rashid testified that he forfeited $1.325m of pay and lost “several million” dollars worth of equity interests when he left Apollo.

A $10,049 flight to Brazil
The former dealmaker’s spending spree spanned three continents, according to a review of information submitted on expenses claims, witness testimony and other evidence shown in court.

A $180 charge for a meal with a management team in 2010 turned out to be paid to a vendor called La Contessa — a high-end hair salon rather than a restaurant. A $3,850 charge in 2011, ostensibly for gifts for executives at Apollo portfolio companies, coincided with the same amount being deposited into a store account that Mr Rashid’s father used to buy thousands of dollars worth of designer clothes. After Apollo enquired about the expense, Mr Rashid had luxury brand Ermenegildo Zegna fax a handwritten receipt for $3,500 worth of “ties for gifts”. Judge Castel dismissed the store assistant’s testimony as “crafted to cover for a valued customer”.

In Manhattan, Mr Rashid took friends to Spasso, an exclusive Italian joint favoured by celebrities such Ashton Kutcher. Submitting the $359 bill to Apollo, Mr Rashid falsely claimed that he had been dining with a chief executive of a sheet metal manufacturer owned by the group. In Miami, he enjoyed a $143 dinner with friends at high-end Asian restaurant Hakkasan. “I feel slightly lame for going to a chain,” one of his dining companions wrote in an email, “but it’s a European chain so I got over it.”


Investors in Apollo’s funds didn’t just foot the bill for the dealmaker’s meals. They paid for his travel, including a $10,049 flight to Brazil for a trip that Mr Rashid characterised as a “vacation”, according to the testimony of a portfolio company executive. A bachelor party in Montreal and a friend’s wedding in Miami were among the other junkets.

When Mr Rashid travelled to San Francisco to attend his brother-in-law’s funeral in August 2011, the $1,866 plane ticket was charged to an Apollo fund. Mr Rashid explained that he met a Goldman Sachs banker after the service, but his then-wife testified that she did not recall her husband conducting any business during the trip.

Emails between the pair seemed to lay out the former Apollo executive’s method for defraying personal expenses. When his wife, who worked at another private equity firm, noted the rising price of plane tickets for a planned family trip to Dallas in 2010, Mr Rashid advised: “visit your port[folio] co[mpany] on the same trip.”

The court found that Mr Rashid employed a similar technique, “deliberately us[ing] the happenstance of [two business associates] presence in New Orleans at or about the time of the Super Bowl as a false justification for seeking reimbursement” for yet more personal travel. A lawyer for Mr Rashid declined to comment, citing active SEC proceedings that could result in his being barred from the investment industry. His former wife is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Mixing business and personal travel was the norm at Apollo, according to Mr Rashid, who testified to being told: “travel, don’t sit around, go find new deals”. He added that founder Leon Black and other top Apollo executives including Marc Rowan, Josh Harris and Scott Kleinman “[would say] in passing, things like, you know, ‘the firm will cover that’, or ‘the firm will pay for this’ or, you know, ‘just bill it to the firm’”.

Billed regardless
Yet unbeknown to Mr Rashid and many of his colleagues, Apollo often was not paying the bills, but passing them to outside investors.

All entities affected by the individual’s wrongdoing were fully and promptly repaid

Apollo statement
“It appears that private-equity funds were billed regardless of the nature of the expense, in contradiction to the limited partnership agreements that governed the funds”, wrote Judge Castel, who found the practice so alarming that he mused in court that “maybe there should be more defendants in this case”. 

He wrote in his opinion that even current Apollo chief financial officer Martin Kelly and his predecessor Eugene Donnelly wrongly believed that Apollo was covering some of the charges.

Apollo said in a statement to the Financial Times that neither it nor any of its current employees were a party to the case, and that “all entities affected by the individual’s wrongdoing were fully and promptly repaid”.

The firm said that it upholds “the highest legal, ethical, and regulatory standards, and has absolutely no tolerance for this type of unacceptable behavior”. It added: “The court’s ruling was solely focused on a former employee’s liability for purposefully falsified business expenses through ‘a pattern of lies’ nearly 10 years ago.”

The ruling from Judge Castel comes eight years after Apollo retained law firm Paul, Weiss to review its expenses systems. The firm, which has represented Apollo in several high-stakes lawsuits and is now advising Mr Black on matters stemming from his relationship with the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, found that of 300 top Apollo employees, only Mr Rashid’s expense submissions “warranted more in-depth review”.

The investigation identified about $20,000 of personal expenses incurred by executives other than Mr Rashid that needed to be repaid, but found no widespread misconduct. In fact, in a presentation prepared for the SEC and later filed in court, Paul, Weiss concluded that Apollo had picked up the tab for more than $370,000 of expenses that should instead have been borne by funds it managed for outside investors.

The findings of the investigation by Paul, Weiss now stand alongside those of a federal judge who ruled that “policies and procedures within Apollo contributed heavily to any act of fraud that was effected on investors in the Apollo funds”.

Vitol, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, has agreed to pay over $160m to authorities in the US and Brazil as it admitted bribery in three countries and was accused of trying to manipulating oil benchmarks.

The trading group paid bribes in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico across 15 years to gain an edge against competitors and secure contracts, it admitted on Thursday in a criminal settlement with the US Department of Justice.

Vitol also settled civil charges brought by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleging that it attempted to manipulate two S&P Global Platts physical oil benchmarks in 2014 and 2015.

The company neither admitted nor denied the claims in the CFTC case. In Brazil, Vitol entered into a civil resolution related to the bribery conduct.

“We understand the seriousness of this matter and are pleased it has been resolved. We will continue to enhance our procedures and controls in line with best practice,” said Russell Hardy, Vitol’s chief executive.

In the bribery case, Vitol admitted that its employees and agents paid about $8m of bribes to officials at Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned energy company, between 2005 and 2014, including to obtain inside information to gain an edge in oil auctions.

Between 2015 and 2020, the company paid about $2m in bribes to officials in Ecuador and Mexico to obtain business and inside information, Vitol admitted.

Earlier this year, US prosecutors charged Javier Aguilar, a former Vitol manager, with bribery offences relating to Ecuador. He has denied the charges. The Ecuador part of Vitol’s settlement dealt with the same conduct charged in Mr Aguilar’s case.

“Vitol paid bribes to government officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico to win lucrative business contracts and obtain competitive advantages to which they were not fairly entitled,” said Seth DuCharme, the acting US attorney in Brooklyn.

The settlement, revealed on Thursday at a virtual hearing in New York federal court, draws a line for Vitol under a criminal investigation by the DoJ into the trading group’s conduct.

Vitol’s US unit was charged with two counts of conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as part of a three-year deferred prosecution agreement that includes its Swiss entity, Vitol SA.

The $135m criminal penalty it agreed to pay was below the $180m-$360m fine range suggested by legal guidelines.

Derek Ettinger, a prosecutor with the justice department’s fraud section, said at the hearing the reduction was due to Vitol’s “full co-operation” with the probe and remediation of the conduct identified.

Vitol is the world’s biggest independent oil trader. It shifts 8m barrels a day of oil and refined fuels, the equivalent of the combined consumption of the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

Last year, the London-headquartered company posted net income of $2.2bn, according to bankers who have seen the privately held group’s results. It also operates with very low levels of debt.

A portion of the criminal fine, $45m, is set to be paid to Brazilian authorities as part of a civil resolution there. Vitol will also pay an additional $12.7m in disgorgement to the CFTC for the bribery claim, as well as $16m penalty for the alleged benchmark manipulation attempt.

A spokeswoman for S&P Global Platts said the attempted manipulation had been unsuccessful, noting also that the CFTC had not alleged any successful manipulation.

“We maintain that our robust, rigorous and transparent methodology continues to allow S&P Global Platts to publish assessments reflective of market value,” the spokeswoman added.

The Vitol case was the first enforcement action brought by the CFTC involving foreign bribery offences.

Large-scale physical commodity trading often involves operating in countries that have been hotbeds of corruption, or where it is difficult to secure business without agents who work on commission and network with government officials to help land deals. These relationships are the focus of several regulatory probes.

Rival commodity traders Trafigura and Glencore are also being investigated as part of Brazil’s long-running “Lava Jato”, or Car wash, corruption probe.

Prosecutors in Brazil have filed a civil lawsuit against Trafigura, alleging the company and its staff had participated in a bribery scheme to win business from Petrobras.

In a statement Trafigura said: “We understand that various regulatory authorities have been conducting a review of commodity trading firms. We have been responding appropriately to information requests from the authorities.

“Trafigura engaged international counsel from Quinn Emanuel to conduct a review into any allegations of improper payments concerning Petrobras insofar as they may relate to Trafigura. Based on its review to date, which is ongoing, Quinn Emanuel believes any allegations that current management were involved in, or had knowledge of, alleged improper payments to Petrobras are unsupported by the evidence and untrue.”

Sydney men arrested after allegedly sending stolen $2.3 million offshore,"Two southern Sydney men have been charged with dozens of offences under money laundering laws for allegedly transferring at least $2.3 million offshore after nine victims across Australia were defrauded of the money.

NSW Police arrested the men, Mark Estephan and Jamie Ronald Close, on Tuesday following a fraud investigation launched earlier this year, which soon uncovered the alleged large-scale international money-laundering operation.

Mark Estephan has been charged with 41 offences under anti-money laundering laws. 
Mark Estephan has been charged with 41 offences under anti-money laundering laws.

With assistance from financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC, investigators discovered a series of unauthorised remittance transfers to accounts in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

According to police, victims were lured by a person who has yet to be identified and convinced to put their money into a number of investment opportunities that promised low risk and high return.

""Part of their ploy was to reward these customers with small returns and then of course they were convinced to invest larger amounts,"" Sutherland Police Area Command Crime Manager, Detective Inspector Andrea Panozzo, alleged.

""And we tracked the funds into [accounts controlled by the accused men] and we noticed they were being transferred offshore to Asian, Middle Eastern and European countries.""

Jamie Ronald Close was arrested on Tuesday and charged with 18 offences under money-laundering laws.

Mr Estephan, 40, was arrested outside Sutherland police station on Tuesday afternoon and charged with 41 unauthorised remittance offences under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, dealing with proceeds of crime and possessing goods suspected of being stolen.

Police will allege Mr Estephan used accounts under his Sydney-based company A.C.E Global Consulting, which bills itself online as an ""AWARD WINNING FIRM that offers a wide range of consulting services Specialising in Business Consulting and Investment Banking"".

Jamie Ronald Close, 49, was arrested at his Kirrawee home and charged with 18 offences under the anti-money laundering laws, driving a vehicle while his licence was suspended, two counts of possessing goods suspected of being stolen, and two counts of dealing with proceeds of crime greater than $100,000.

Search warrants executed in Kirrawee and Cronulla uncovered $170,000 in cash, 64kg of silver bullion worth an estimated $55,000 and two ounces of gold bullion worth an estimated $5000.

The men had not registered their operations with AUSTRAC as remittance businesses and were therefore not authorised to make the transfers.

""This is a large-scale coordinated criminal enterprise we have successfully disrupted,"" Detective Inspector Panozzo alleged.

Nine victims across NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia have been identified so far but more could be found as the investigation continues. One family was allegedly defrauded out of $1 million while others lost smaller amounts.

AUSTRAC national manager of education, capability and communications, Brad Brown, said international remittance transfers were generally legitimate but businesses facilitating the transfers had to be registered.

He said people involved in all kinds of criminal activity, including fraud, might seek to illegally transfer proceeds of crime overseas.

""The further you distance yourself from the illicit proceeds that you have, the harder it is for law enforcement to track those funds across the world,"" Mr Brown said.

In 2019-20, $72 billion was transferred into and out of Australia using registered money transfer services, amounting to 21.7 million transactions reported to AUSTRAC.

SBM Offshore Facing Swiss Probe Over Legacy Bribery Scandal,"Dutch oil services company SBM Offshore is now under criminal investigation by the Swiss government related to a bribery and corruption scandal in which the company has already been fined hundreds of millions of dollars in the U.S., Brazil and the Netherlands.

SBM Swiss bribery
Monday, SBM said three of their subsidiaries received notice from Swiss prosecutors that an investigation was under way into suspicions that the company failed to implement measures to prevent corrupt payments between 2005 and 2015.

The Swiss attorney general’s office claims it opened the criminal probe in connection to earlier proceedings brought against former senior executives at SBM who were found guilty of bribing foreign public officials in July. U.S. prosecutors alleged the two men paid out more than $16 million in bribes to win bids with state-run oil companies and government contracts.

“We will engage with the Swiss public prosecutor and seek clarification,” Erik Lagendijk, SBM’s chief governance and compliance officer, said. “We did not expect this development in Switzerland as Swiss authorities have been involved in the matter from the time of the settlement in the Netherlands in 2014.”

The harsh penalties SBM face highlight that violation of anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can result in separate investigations from all parties effected, sometimes even years later. SBM paid the U.S. $238 million in 2017 to settle allegations that the company paid almost $190 million to middlemen while knowing that portions of the money would go toward bribing government officials in Brazil, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Iraq. Three years earlier, the drilling company agreed to pay $240 million to Dutch authorities in a separate probe related to the same business dealings.

Earlier this month, SBM concluded a three-year reporting requirement as part of the 2017 deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice related to bribery violations across three continents.

“The completion of our reporting to the Department of Justice marks the strength of the control measures the Company put in place,” Mr. Lagendijk said in a statement.

The legal probe is likely to result in an eventual settlement of some sort as it will be hard to disprove the findings of the investigation considering SBM’s involvement in the corruption and bribery ring has already led to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines already.",am,https://hauteliving.com/hautelawyer/636657/sbm-offshore-facing-swiss-probe-legacy-bribery-scandal/

American ex-soldier allegedly provided material support to Syrian-based terrorist,"Prosecutors said Bell used encrypted applications to communicate with and provide advice to the group.

A former U.S. soldier was arrested Wednesday in connection to providing financial support to a self-identified member of al-Nusra Front, a designated terrorist organization based in Syria, according to federal prosecutors.

Maria Bell, 53, of Hopatcong, N.J., was arrested at her home by FBI agents. She was due to make her initial court appearance via video conference Wednesday afternoon.

It wasn’t immediately clear if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.

Bell is accused of providing material support to the al-Nusra Front, which operates in northwest Syria, according to the Department of Justice. The group also goes by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and was at one point linked to Al Qaeda.

Starting in February 2017, prosecutors said Bell used encrypted applications to communicate with and provide advice to the group.

In communicating with group members, Bell cited her professional experience in specialized weapons training while on active duty in the U.S. Army and Army National Guard, prosecutors said. She also offered to provide guidance concerning operational security issues, weapons purchases and military knowledge.

Authorities said Bell communicated with and provided money to one self-identified group member via Western Union, using an intermediary to conceal the source of the funds. The group member was not identified.

If convicted, Bell faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.  ",am,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-ex-soldier-charged-providing-support-syrian-terrorist

Suspected Islamist terrorist goes on trial over France train attack thwarted by 3 Americans,"The incident was turned into a Hollywood flick by director Clint Eastwood

A suspected Islamist extremist went on trial Monday in Paris for an attack aboard a high-speed train in 2015 that injured several passengers before three Americans brought him down.

Moroccan national Ayoub El Khazzani, 31, boarded the train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris on Aug. 21, 2015, with an arsenal of weapons. He shot one passenger and injured two others with a cutter.

The three Americans – two U.S. servicemen and a student – who thwarted the attack are expected to testify in the monthlong trial.

Their lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, said at the courthouse Monday that their ""very brave intervention"" had thwarted a “slaughter.”

“This terror attack could have killed up to 300 people based on the number of ammunition that was found on the terrorist and in his bag,” he said.

Clint Eastwood turned the dramatic incident into a Hollywood film, “The 15:17 to Paris.""

El Khazzani appeared in court Monday flanked by security guards while the trial opening largely dealt with procedural issues, including whether Eastwood would be needed. The actor-director has not yet responded to a summons.

The 31-year-old Moroccan spent several months in Syria and boarded the train in Brussels heavily armed, authorities said. He is charged with attempted terrorist murder. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Three others, who weren't on the train, also are being tried as alleged accomplices.

El Khazzani emerged bare-chested from a restroom between cars armed with a Kalashnikov, nine clips with 30 rounds each, an automatic pistol and a cutter, according to investigators. He shot a French-American man with the pistol after he wrestled the Kalashnikov away.

Spencer Stone, then a 23-year-old U.S. airman, has said he was coming out of a deep sleep when the gunman appeared. He said that Alek Skarlatos, then a 22-year-old U.S. National Guardsman recently back from Afghanistan, “just hit me on the shoulder and said ‘Let’s go.’”

The men, all from California, snapped into action out of what Skarlatos said at a news conference days later was “gut instinct.” Stone and Skarlatos moved in to tackle the gunman and take his gun. A third man, Anthony Sadler, 23, then a student, helped subdue the assailant.

Airbus bribery fallout: Investigations launched worldwide,"AirAsia’s chiefs step aside, while Ghana, Colombia and Sri Lanka are launching investigations into Airbus dealings.

Fallout from the Airbus bribery scandal reverberated around the world as the head of one of its top buyers temporarily stood down and investigations were launched in countries aggrieved at being dragged into the increasingly political dispute.

The European planemaker is bracing for a rocky period with airlines and foreign governments, some of which have complained they were not forewarned about the charges and said they had little knowledge of the sums of money swirling around their fleet purchases.

Airbus agreed on Friday to pay a record $4bn in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in the United Kingdom, France and United States over alleged bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years.

“Friday was the end of Act I, now we are seeing the beginning of Act II with possible repercussions on airline relationships,” a person close to the company told the Reuters news agency.

Airbus declined to comment further after welcoming the agreement on Friday as an opportunity to “turn the page”.

Prosecution documents agreed by Airbus detailed a global network of agents or middlemen in transactions across the group’s business and run from a cell in Paris where the group had part of its headquarters, split between France and Germany.

Outlines of the operation and its annual budget of 250 million to 300 million euros ($277m to $332m) had been reported by Reuters.

Prosecutors also cited parallel projects or investments alongside some negotiations, including the sponsorship by Airbus’ then-parent EADS of a Formula 1 team owned by top officials at Malaysia-based AirAsia, an important customer.

Shares in AirAsia fell up to 11 percent.

AirAsia Group said Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes and Chairman Kamarudin Meranun would step aside for at least two months while the airline and Malaysian government probed allegations.

In a joint statement, the two co-founders of Asia’s largest budget airline denied any wrongdoing or misconduct.

“We would not harm the very companies that we spent our entire lives building up to their present global status,” they said.

Fernandes, one of aviation’s best known executives, already faces domestic pressure after backing former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2018 elections. Najib was overthrown by Mahathir Mohamad, prompting Fernandes to apologise for backing the losing candidate.

Inquiries launched
In Ghana, a political storm erupted over accusations of Airbus payments to a relative of a government official in connection with the purchase of military transport planes.

The UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said the agent had no aerospace experience, having previously worked in football merchandising and as a facilities manager. It did not say what the agent, who had been helped by two unnamed British television actors, did with the money.

President Nana Akufo-Addo’s office said Ghana would “conduct a prompt inquiry to determine the complicity or otherwise of any Ghanaian government official, past or present”.

The National Democratic Congress (NDC), which was in power at the time, said claims that Airbus paid bribes were false.

In Colombia, airline Avianca said it had hired a law firm to investigate its relationship with Airbus and determine if it had been a victim of wrongdoing.

French prosecutors said in settlement documents that Airbus had agreed to pay multi-million dollar commissions to an agent over jet sales to Avianca, some of which were earmarked for a senior executive at the airline’s parent Avianca Holdings.

The payments were thwarted by a freeze on agent commissions as Airbus tightened processes in 2014, they said.

Avianca is ultimately owned by Synergy Group, formerly the vehicle of Bolivian-born entrepreneur German Efromovich who bought the airline out of bankruptcy in 2004 and grew it to become Latin America’s second-largest. He lost control of Synergy in 2019. Contacted by Reuters, Efromovich declined to comment.

Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a full investigation after the UK’s SFO reported that Airbus had hired the wife of a SriLankan Airlines executive as its intermediary in connection with aircraft negotiations.

Airbus misled UK export credit agency UKEF over her name and gender while paying her company $2m, the SFO said.

Korean Air and Taiwan’s China Airlines declined to comment on allegations of payments to intermediaries over the jet purchases.

Settlements in France and the US also trained a spotlight on dealings in China, which tends to be supplied through large plane orders coinciding with state visits.

Prosecutor findings issued with the settlement detailed alleged bribery and hospitality paid for using money diverted from a pilot-training fund, into which Airbus made payments.

Analysts had said Airbus is poised to win more business in China as a result of recent US-Chinese trade tensions, though the prospect of a trade deal has also boosted rival US planemaker Boeing Co.

Chinese aviation officials, many affected by an order to government officials to work at home due to the coronavirus outbreak, could not be reached for comment. But the foreign ministry said, “China has always attached great importance to its cooperation with France in the aviation industry”.",am,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/2/4/airbus-bribery-fallout-investigations-launched-worldwide
AIRBUS BRIBERY INVESTIGATION HIGHLIGHTS POWER OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN TACKLING CORRUPTION,"Loopholes to plea deals must be addressed to ensure justice is served

A €3.6bn (£3bn) corporate plea deal struck by Airbus to end a long-running corruption probe must now be followed up by prosecuting executives involved. Failing to hold individuals to account will damage public confidence and risks setting a precedent where big companies can buy their way out of trouble.

Courts in the UK, France and United States last week approved the deal – known as a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) – after the aerospace giant admitted to using middlemen to pay bribes to secure aircraft contracts.

Airbus itself will not be prosecuted under the terms of the DPA, meaning the company avoids a criminal conviction. However the UK’s Serious Fraud Office is still able to prosecute Airbus executives involved with the bribery.

Transparency International UK firmly believes that DPAs are only successful when they are followed up with investigations and prosecutions against individuals responsible for the wrongdoing.

Daniel Bruce, Chief Executive of Transparency International UK, said:

“The Airbus settlement figures are huge, certainly compared to previous Deferred Prosecution Agreements in the UK; this is to be welcomed. Large penalties are a quick and effective way to sanction companies for wrongdoing, but they should be but one of a number of consequences for egregious corruption cases such as this. Individual prosecutions in this case are vital to ensure that justice is seen to be done. Failing to go after those involved will give the impression that big companies play by a different set of rules and can simply buy their way out of trouble.

“Record-breaking settlements totalling billions of pounds are likely to grab the headlines here, but behind the numbers there are real people caught up in bribery and corruption cases. Endemic corruption in some of the world’s poorest countries costs lives and ruins many more, and bribery sanctioned by one of the world’s biggest companies helps perpetuate this.”

The SFO began investigating Airbus in 2016 after the company reported itself to authorities. Parquet National Financier, the French equivalent of the SFO, launched its own investigation in 2017.

Transparency International France had campaigned actively in 2016 to include CJIPs, the French version of DPAs, into law.

Marc-André Feffer, Chair of Transparency International France, said:

“Before the CJIP was implemented in France in 2016, no company had been convicted for corruption, leading to an unacceptable state a near-impunity in the last 15 years. The Airbus case is a good example of how this new judicial procedure is a powerful leverage in the hands of the Parquet National Financier (also a young institution created only in 2014). Huge fines are a quick and effective way to hit companies where it hurts while avoiding the long, complex and highly uncertain process of trials. However, the CJIPs now need to be evaluated and maybe improved to make sure it contains no potential loopholes and avoid to be a tool for companies to ‘buy their way out of trouble’.”

In France, the CJIP is an efficient tool that facilitates unprecedented international cooperation in major transnational bribery cases. However, we regret that no company has ever spontaneously come forwards to denounce their illicit wrong doing to French authorities. We will remain on the lookout.",am,https://www.transparency.org/en/press/airbus-bribery-investigation-highlights-power-of-international-cooperation
MACC arrests three company directors for alleged bribery over RM90mil govt contract,"PUTRAJAYA: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has arrested three company directors for alleged bribery to secure an advertising contract worth RM90mil under a government agency last year.

The directors, aged from 31 and 48, were arrested on Wednesday (June 10) evening when they were called to have their statements recorded here.

Sources said that investigators had also identified officers of the government agency who were involved.

""The MACC expects to carry out a series of arrests against individuals who we believe are in league with the directors,"" said the source.

According to the source, the company had provided false information for a tender and were later awarded the contract.

It is believed the company did not have the right qualification for the job and had in fact failed a technical and financial evaluation.

""However, because they had bribed certain officials, conditions that the company had to meet were set aside, were awarded the job,"" said the source.

It is understood that the bribery involved a sum of RM5mil.

MACC deputy chief commissioner Datuk Seri Ahmad Khusairi Yahaya confirmed the arrests.

He said the suspects have been remanded for four days.",am,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/06/11/macc-arrests-three-company-directors-for-alleged-bribery-over-rm90mil-govt-contract
Apple’s head of security charged with bribery,"It’s alleged that the Santa Clara County, California sheriff's office held up an application for a concealed-weapons permit until an agreement was made for Apple to donate $70,000 (£52 thousand) worth of iPads

Apple's head of global security was charged with bribery last week for allegedly promising to donate iPads to the Santa Clara County, California, sheriff's office in exchange for concealed-weapons permits, according to an indictment made public on Monday.

The charges are part of a broad two-year investigation into the sheriff's office, according to a news release on the Santa Clara County district attorney's website. The investigation explored an alleged scheme to trade concealed weapons permits in exchange for goods, such as iPads and expensive sports tickets.

Thomas Moyer, who has run Apple's security department since 2013, according to his LinkedIn page, had applied for concealed-weapons permits, according to the release. The sheriff's office held up the application, the news release alleges, until Mr Moyer agreed to get Apple to donate $70,000 (£52 thousand) worth of iPads.

Through his attorney Ed Swanson, Mr Moyer denied the allegations and said there was no quid pro quo. Mr Moyer helped arrange a donation of iPads to a new education centre for the sheriff's office, Mr Swanson said, but that donation was not connected with four concealed-carry permits issued to Apple employees.



""He did nothing wrong and has acted with the highest integrity throughout his career. We have no doubt he will be acquitted at trial,"" Mr Swanson said in a statement.

""As law enforcement officers, we are held to the highest moral and ethical standards,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. ""This is a difficult time for our organization.""

Apple's sprawling headquarters in Cupertino falls within Santa Clara County and is staffed with security. Concealed-weapon permits are rarely granted in the county.

Santa Clara Undersheriff Rick Sung and Capt. James Jensen, who allegedly requested the bribes, were also indicted.

Jeff Rosen, the Santa Clara district attorney, said Mr Sung and Mr Jensen treated concealed-carry permits ""like commodities""; he also faulted those who allegedly paid the bribes. ""Bribe seekers should be reported to the District Attorney's Office, not rewarded with compliance,"" he said in a statement.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In recent years, as technology companies have drawn more interest and scrutiny from the public, some companies have dealt with physical security threats. In 2018, a woman shot three people at YouTube's headquarters in nearby San Bruno, California, before shooting herself.

Security at Apple goes beyond physical threats. The company tries to protect its trade secrets and its supply chain from competitors and other outsiders who try to uncover company secrets.

Mr Moyer's role at the company included helping employees through natural disasters, Mr Swanson said. Mr Swanson said part of his client's role was in looking for opportunities to help the law enforcement community, which includes donations of equipment, such as iPads. The ""wrongheaded prosecution,"" he said, was the result of ""collateral damage"" in a battle between the district attorney's office and the sheriff's office, which led to the charges, he said.

Mr Moyer served as Apple's chief compliance officer from 2009 to 2013, according to his LinkedIn page. One responsibility of a compliance officer is to ensure that companies follow anti-bribery laws.

The indictment comes about a year after an Apple attorney in charge of enforcing the company's insider trading policies was indicted on insider trading charges.",am,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/apple-bribery-california-us-b1760887.html
Ex-Interpol president who went missing for months indicted on bribery charges in China,"Prosecutor’s office says he abused position to ‘illegally accept cash and property in return for performing favours’

Chinese prosecutors indicted former Interpol president Meng Hongwei on Friday on charges of accepting bribes, the latest development in a case that began with his disappearance while on a journey to Beijing.

The announcement from the prosecutor’s office in the northeastern city of Tianjin said Mr Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice minister of public security and head of the maritime police to “illegally accept cash and property in return for performing favours for others”.

“The amounts were especially huge,” the statement said.

Earlier, the ruling Communist Party’s disciplinary committee said an investigation found that Mr Meng abused his power in order to satisfy his family’s “extravagant lifestyle”.

He was formally arrested last month after being expelled from public office and the party.

While serving at Interpol, Mr Meng retained his title as a vice minister of public security.

Elected president of the international police organisation in 2016, he had his four-year term cut short when he disappeared into custody after travelling to China from the body’s headquarters in France at the end of September.

Interpol was not informed and was forced to make a formal request to China for information about Mr Meng’s whereabouts.

There are suspicions he had fallen out of political favour with Chinese president Xi Jinping, who has carried out a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption and perceived disloyalty that observers say is calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority.

Mr Meng’s wife has accused Chinese authorities of lying and questioned whether her husband was still alive.

More Than 30 Charged in Scheme to Fix Coast Guard Test Scores,"An employee at a Coast Guard testing center entered false scores in exchange for bribes, federal prosecutors say.

For more than seven years, prosecutors say, a Coast Guard employee at a test center in Louisiana took bribes to enter falsified test scores, allowing two dozen people to obtain licenses required for various positions on vessels without passing the exams.

Last week, that employee, Dorothy Smith, a credentialing specialist at the center in Mandeville, La., and 30 other people were indicted in the scheme, prosecutors said on Monday.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Ms. Smith worked with intermediaries to secure bribes. Two former Coast Guard employees are among the six intermediaries whom prosecutors said Ms. Smith used as part of the operation. The other four, who were workers in the maritime industry, had their scores fixed by Ms. Smith in addition to recruiting others.

In exchange for the bribes, Ms. Smith falsely reported that the applicants had earned passing scores on exams or learning modules, prosecutors said, and in some cases reported that the applicants had appeared for the tests when they had not.

The exams test “mariners’ knowledge and training to safely operate under the authority of licenses,” according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Ms. Smith and the six intermediaries were each charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. A lawyer representing Ms. Smith in the case declined to comment.

The scheme “resulted in the applicants illegally obtaining a range of licenses for officer-level positions, including the most important positions on vessels, such as master, chief mate, and chief engineer,” the statement said.

The Coast Guard did not immediately respond on Tuesday night to a request for comment.

Twenty-four other people face charges in the case. They were charged with receiving, possessing and intending to unlawfully use mariner licenses by way of the false scores. Some applicants had their scores fixed on multiple occasions, prosecutors said.

One applicant paid an intermediary $3,500 for fake scores, according to the indictment. Another paid Ms. Smith $1,000 directly, prosecutors said. They did not say how much Ms. Smith and her associates made in the scheme.

If convicted, each of the 31 defendants could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, prosecutors said.

The case is being investigated by the Coast Guard Investigative Service. It was unclear how investigators became aware of the operation.

The indictment came more than a year after dozens of people were charged in an unrelated widespread college admissions cheating scandal. Those charges resulted from the Justice Department’s “Varsity Blues” investigation and involved celebrities including the actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.

The investigation revealed that wealthy parents had paid to have their children’s admissions scores fixed, sometimes in conjunction with falsified résumés and bribes to coaches to admit students as competitive athletes.

Last week, a former fencing coach at Harvard was accused of taking $1.5 million in bribes to assist a wealthy Maryland businessman’s sons in being admitted to the school.

Queensland man charged with plotting terror attack in Bundaberg,"A man has been charged with plotting a terrorist attack in a coastal Queensland town.
Former journalist James Waugh is accused of planning a violent extremist attack in the coastal town of Bundaberg.
The 29-year-old Kepnock man was arrested by a Joint Counter Terror Team from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Queensland Police yesterday.

He had been planning a terror act in the Bundaberg region and had sought firearms training, investigators allege.
The investigation into Mr Waugh was sparked after he allegedly made threats towards a member of the public last month.
He has been charged with one count of acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts.
If found guilty, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

A property in Kepnock was raided on November 3 and a number of electronic devices and a notebook were seized by police.
It was alleged in court that the electronic devices contained documents indicating a desire to undertake acts of violent extremism.
The AFP's Assistant Commissioner Counter Terrorism, Scott Lee, said investigators worked quickly to prevent a terror act.
""The investigation highlights the professionalism and dedication of the individuals and agencies involved in the JCTT, and their commitment to bringing people to account for their criminal actions,"" he said.

Four years later he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years jail with a non-parole period of 12 years.
He was widely considered to be the spiritual leader of the group of men arrested over the plans.
His sentence expired on November 5 this year, but was kept in jail due to an interim detention order from the Victorian Supreme Court.

"Accused terror killer identified after woman decapitated in Nice, France","The identity of the man accused of decapitating a 60-year-old woman and killing two others in the French city of Nice has been revealed.
Authorities earlier named the man as Brahim Aouissaoui, a 21-year-old Tunisian migrant.
A source in the Italian interior ministry told CNN that Aouissaoui first arrived in Europe on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa.
He arrived in France early this month, AFP reports.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has condemned the terror attack as a ""callous act of barbarism"".
He told Ben Fordham on 2GB that he had spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Mr Morrison said Australia stood with the French people.
""This is a very awful thing that has occurred. We share values. We stand for the same thing,"" Mr Morrison said.
Mr Morrison also rebuked former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad who said Muslims ""have a right to kill millions of French people"" just hours after the Nice attack.
""That is an absolutely absurd statement,"" he said.
Mr Morrison said the only sensible response to the incident was of ""utter condemnation"".
France is at an ""emergency"" alert level and is doubling the number of soldiers deployed to 7000 across the country after the killings at the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice.
A man armed with a knife attacked two women and a man at the church on Thursday morning (Thursday evening AEDT) before he was shot by police. As he lay wounded, the Nice mayor said the attacker repeated ""Allahu Akbar"" over and over. French authorities have opened a terrorism investigation.
French churches have been ferociously attacked by extremists in recent years, and Thursday's killings come ahead of the Roman Catholic All Saints' holiday.
The Nice attack is the third in two months in France that authorities have attributed to Muslim extremists, including the beheading of a teacher.
It comes during a growing furore over caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that were republished by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo — renewing vociferous debate in France and the Muslim world over the depictions that Muslims consider offensive but are protected by French free speech laws
The Nice assailant, who was armed with a knife, was wounded by police and hospitalised after the killings at the Notre Dame Church, less than 1km from the site in 2016 where another attacker plowed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd, killing dozens.
Police were not searching for any other assailants.
""It seems that, according to the first findings of the police, the woman who was inside the church has been decapitated. For the other victims, we cannot say anything at the moment,"" said mayor Christian Estrosi, telling BFM television that three people had died, two inside the church and a third who fled but was mortally wounded.
""He cried 'Allahu Akbar' over and over, even after he was injured. The meaning of his gesture left no doubt.""
Shots punctuated the air and witnesses screamed as police stationed at the grandiose doors to the church appeared to fire at the attacker inside, according to videos obtained by The Associated Press.
Hours later, AP reporters at the scene saw emergency vehicles and police tape lining the wide Notre Dame Avenue leading toward the plaza in front of the basilica. For a time after the attack, sounds of explosions could be heard as sappers exploded suspicious objects.
France's anti-terrorism prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the attack, the third one since a trial began in September for people linked to the 2015 attacks at Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket by gunmen who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. The trial is nearing its end, with a verdict planned for November 13, the fifth anniversary of another series of deadly Islamic State attacks in Paris.
Thursday's attacker was believed to be acting alone and police are not searching for other assailants, said two police officials, who were not authorised to be publicly named.
""With the attack against (teacher) Samual Paty, it was freedom of speech that was targeted. With this attack in Nice, it is freedom of religion,"" Mr Castex told lawmakers.
Earlier, the lower house of parliament suspended a debate on France's new virus restrictions and held a moment of silence for the victims. Mr Castex rushed from the hall to a crisis centre overseeing the aftermath of the Nice attack and later returned to announce the alert level increase.
Simultaneous attacks
Muslims have held protests in several countries and called for a boycott of French goods in response to France's stance on caricatures of Islam's most revered prophet, whose birthday was marked in several countries Thursday. Soon before Thursday's attack, supporters of religious political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam protested in Pakistan against Macron.
In Avignon on Thursday morning, an armed man was shot to death by police after he refused to drop his weapon and a flash-ball shot failed to stop him, one police official said. And a Saudi state-run news agency said a man stabbed a guard at the French consulate in Jiddah, wounding the guard before he was arrested.
Islamic State extremists had issued a video on Wednesday renewing calls for attacks against France.
Many groups and nations, however, issued their condolences Thursday, standing firmly with France.
The French Council of the Muslim Faith condemned the Nice attack and called on French Muslims to refrain from festivities this week marking the birth of Muhammad ""as a sign of mourning and in solidarity with the victims and their loved ones.""
Turkey's Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the attack in Nice. ""We stand in solidarity with the people of France against terror and violence,"" the statement said.
Relations between Turkey and France hit a new low after Turkey's president on Saturday accused Macron of Islamophobia over the caricatures and questioned his mental health, prompting Paris to recall its ambassador to Turkey for consultations.
The attack in Nice came less than two weeks after another assailant beheaded a French middle school teacher who showed the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad for a class on free speech. Those caricatures were published by Charlie Hebdo and cited by the men who gunned down the newspaper's editorial meeting in 2015.
In September, a man who had sought asylum in France attacked bystanders outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices with a butcher knife.
French Roman Catholic sites have been ferociously and repeatedly targeted by extremists in recent years, including the killing of the Rev. Jaqcues Hamel, who had his throat slit while celebrating Mass in his Normandy church by Islamic militants and a plot to bomb Paris' Notre Dame cathedral.
Those attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group, which also is believed to have recruited a man now on trial who plotted unsuccessfully to attack a church on the outskirts of Paris.
Nice's 19th-century basilica Notre Dame de l'Assomption is the largest church in the city, but smaller and newer than the cathedral 2km away.
The basilica's twin neogothic towers, standing 65 metres high, are a landmark feature in the heart of the city.

Convicted killer who helped thwart London Bridge terrorist attack up for early release,"The convicted murderer who tackled a London Bridge terrorist with a narwhal tusk is set for early release from prison.
Steve Gallant, 42, was on day release when he confronted terrorist Usman Khan along with other members of the public last November.
Gallant will be offered a 10-month reduced sentence, with his parole hearing moved forward to next June, under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, reports the BBC.
His release is pending a decision for the Parole Board which will take after a full risk assessment.
Gallant was jailed for 17 years in 2005 for the murder of former firefighter Barrie Jackson in Hull, northern England.
Convicted terrorist Khan, 28, killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, at Fishmongers Hall next to London Bridge during a conference that aimed to help rehabilitate prisoners.
After Khan attacked Mr Merritt and Ms Jones, Gallant grabbed an ornamental 1.5 metre narwhal tusk from a wall and chased the terrorist on to the bridge, where Khan was shot dead by police.
The decision to recommend an early release for Gallant has been backed by his victim's family, the Mirror reports.
Jackson's student son Jack, 21, said: ""I have mixed emotions – but what happened at London Bridge goes to show the reality that people can change.""
He added that one day he may meet Gallant.

Mr Merritt's father David also backed the move.
""Steve fully deserves this pardon, or reduction in sentence,"" he told the Mirror.
""It is fantastic. He was very close to Jack and he turned his life around and reformed. I am really pleased for him.""
A spokesman for the UK Ministry of Justice said: ""The Lord Chancellor has granted Steven Gallant a Royal Prerogative of Mercy reducing his minimum tariff of 10 months in recognition of his exceptionally brave actions at Fishmongers' Hall, which helped save people's lives despite the tremendous risk to his own.""",am,https://www.9news.com.au/world/convicted-murderer-who-confronted-london-bridge-attacker-pardoned/2ae9f558-8ea2-460b-8ea6-c52570ba90ec
Rogue Afghan soldier who killed three Australians 'flown to Qatar' on eve of key peace talks,"A rogue Afghan soldier who killed three Australian servicemen has reportedly been flown to Qatar in the lead-up to peace negotiations with the Taliban.
Private Robert Poate, Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic and Sapper James Martin were murdered by Afghan army sergeant, Hekmatullah, who was later captured and sentenced to death.
The ABC has reported Hekmatullah boarded a flight that took six prisoners to Doha.
""The six will remain in Qatar until the end of November and could be transferred back to Kabul,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
Hekmatullah may soon be released as part of a prisoner swap deal being orchestrated by US President Donald Trump's administration.
The move has drawn the criticism of Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
""Hekmatullah was responsible for murdering three Australians and our position is he should never be released,"" he said.
""It is a matter that I've written to the President about.
""We do not believe his release adds to peace in the region.""
Hekmatullah's potential freedom has also enraged Mr Milosevic's brother, Milan, who says pressure should be applied on the Afghani government.
""Don't let it happen – it's that simple,"" he said.
The arrival of the prisoners in Qatar coincides with long-awaited peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government's negotiating team set to begin tomorrow in the Gulf Arab state.
The talks — known as intra-Afghan negotiations — were laid out in a peace deal that Washington brokered with the Taliban and signed in February, also in Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office.

Swedbank chief executive sacked as €135bn money laundering scandal escalates,"Birgitte Bonnesen dismissed after allegations that accounts at the bank she ran were used to wash €20bn a year of suspicious cash, including funds from Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort

Swedbank has sacked its chief executive after allegations that accounts at the lender were used to launder billions of dollars of questionable Russian and Ukrainian money.

Stockholm-based Swedbank was allegedly a conduit for some of the world’s most notorious strongmen including deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich. This week reports emerged that Donald Trump’s former campaign manager and convicted felon Paul Manafort also received money via the bank.

Swedbank’s chief executive Birgitte Bonnesen was dismissed on Thursday after investigators in Sweden and Estonia opened up probes into €135bn (£115bn) of suspicious cash.

US authorities are also looking into the bank which is linked to what is thought to be the world’s largest ever money laundering case.


The allegations tie Swedbank to a €200bn dirty money scandal centring on Danske Bank. The Danish lender’s Estonia branch uncovered nine years of suspicious transactions which lawyers believe had been used by criminals and corrupt officials to launder funds.

According to a whistleblower who uncovered the scandal, UK companies were also used to hide the source of billions of euros of questionable money. The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has said it is investigating the use of UK-registered companies in connection with the widening scandal.

Ms Bonnesen, who ran Swedbank’s Baltic banking unit between 2011 and 2014 was dismissed after denying any link to the money laundering case.

Swedbank’s chief financial officer Anders Karlsson will step up to the top job on an interim basis.

The bank’s headquarters were raided by on Wednesday as part of a separate insider trading investigation into allegations that Swedbank’s biggest investors were given advanced notice of a report into money laundering. After markets closed, it emerged that the bank was also being investigated for fraud.

“The developments during the past days have created an enormous pressure for the bank,” Chairman Lars Idermark said in a statement on Thursday.

Shares in the bank have plummeted almost a third since the scandal first broke last month wiping around €7bn off its market value.

"At least six Pakistani banks named in global money laundering probe
","ISLAMABAD: At least six Pakistani banks have been named in an investigation on the role global banks play in money laundering, which make up to at least $2.5 million.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and Buzzfeed News carried out an investigation and found that at least 29 suspicious transactions worth about $2.5 million related to Pakistani banks, that may have been used for money laundering.

The six banks are Allied Bank, United Bank Limited (UBL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah, Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited.

As per the investigation, all of 29 suspicious transactions were done during the year 2011 and 2012.

The investigation details by Buzzfeed News, shared with the ICIJ revealed that global banks to the US Treasury Department's Intelligence Unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network known as FinCEN, filed over 2,100 suspicious activity reports.

The report revealed that global banks moved more than $2 trillion between 1999 and 2017 in suspicious payments, flagging clients in more than 170 countries, identified as being involved in illicit transaction.

As per revealed data on Pakistani banks, out of the 29 suspicious transactions to and from Pakistan, received transactions amounted to $1,942,560 while the sent transactions were $452,000, which include at least 12 suspicious transactions by Allied Bank, eight flagged transactions by United Bank Limited, three by Bank Alfalah, four transactions by Standard Chartered Bank and one by Habib Bank Limited.

The report has put another dent on global image of Pakistan's crippling economy and its position on money laundering.

It comes at a time when Pakistan is working hard towards fulfilling the 27-point-action plan of the global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Pakistan currently is in the grey list of the FATF and is working on compliance of the action plan to ensure that it saves itself from being pushed ahead into the black list, which would attract global financial sanctions.

Former Little Rock pastor pleads guilty to transporting minors for sexual activity,"A former Little Rock youth pastor pleaded guilty today to transporting minors across state lines for the purpose of unlawful sexual activity. Robert Shiflet, 50, now of Denton, Texas, entered his guilty plea earlier today before United States District Judge Lee P. Rudofsky. Cody Hiland, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Diane Upchurch, Special Agent in Charge of the Little Rock Field Office of the FBI, announced today’s guilty plea

Shiflet pleaded guilty to two separate instances of criminal conduct. One of these accounts began in 1996, when Shiflet met a 14-year-old girl in the youth group he pastored in Denton, Texas. Shiflet frequently made inappropriate comments to the minor and often told her he loved her. In May of 1997, when the minor was 15 years old, Shiflet led an eighth grade camping trip to the Buffalo National River in Arkansas. Shiflet was able to isolate the minor away from the group and then sexually assaulted her. He told her not to tell anyone.

Another minor reported that in 2002, when Shiflet was her youth pastor at a Little Rock church, Shiflet engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with her when she was 16 years old. Shiflet had sex with the minor multiple times during 2002-2003, when Shiflet was 32. In the summer of 2002, the youth group attended an event in Panama City, Florida. On that trip, Shiflet asked the minor to ride on the charter bus with him instead of riding on another bus with her friends. On the bus ride, he sexually assaulted the minor.

“This defendant took advantage of his position of trust as a mentor to young people and instead used his power to isolate and sexually abuse them,” stated U.S. Attorney Hiland. “This predatory behavior is never acceptable, but it is particularly disturbing when the offender is a youth pastor. Our office will continue to aggressively pursue those who commit these deplorable crimes.”

Shiflet was indicted in June 2020 with three counts of transportation of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity and one count of coercion of a minor to engage in sexual activity. In exchange for his guilty plea, the remaining charges were dismissed.

Judge Rudofsky will sentence Shiflet at a later date. Transportation of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity is punishable by not more than 15 years imprisonment and not more than three years of supervised release. The case was investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kristin Bryant.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-little-rock-pastor-pleads-guilty-31220223/
Former DeSales University Catholic Priest indicted on child pornography charges,"A former DeSales University Catholic priest who lives in Wilmington, Delaware, has been indicted on child pornography charges. Rev. William McCandless, a former adviser to Monaco’s royal family, was charged in Philadelphia.

Prosecutors say McCandless — a member of the Wilmington-based religious order Oblates de St. Francis De Sales and formerly assigned to DeSales University in Lehigh County — amassed a trove of thousands of illicit images of children, including some involving torture.

Up until 2017, McCandless had served as the vicar of St. Charles Parish in Monte Carlo, on the French Riviera, and served as a close adviser to the royal family.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office says the 56-year-old former priest amassed his collection of pornographic images while serving in Monte Carlo.

Federal prosecutors say, “he conducted internet searches for things like how to get ‘off the grid,’ how to ‘disappear’ and how to erase items from ‘the cloud.’”

McCandless entered a not guilty plea to charges, including possession and transportation of child pornography.

However, the charges unsealed Wednesday were not the first time McCandless had been on the radar. In 2010, the clergy sex abuse watchdog group, Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, called for his suspension, saying his name had surfaced in an ongoing clergy abuse lawsuit involving a 14-year-old boy.

At the time, McCandless had been assigned to the Salesianum School, a Catholic private high school in Wilmington. He had also previously served for seven years as a chaplain at North Catholic High School in Philadelphia.

McCandless was ordered to be placed on home incarceration, with electronic monitoring, and must also surrender his passport.

If convicted, he faces a maximum of 60 years in prison.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-desales-university-catholic-priest-indicted-312202235/
Energy trader Vitol fined $164 million to settle bribery allegations in Latin America,"Vitol Group’s U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay $164 million to resolve probes by the U.S. government that the energy trader paid bribes in Brazil and other countries to boost its oil trading business, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.

Under a three-year deferred prosecution agreement, the Swiss trading firm admitted guilt and agreed to improve internal reporting and compliance functions.

Vitol, run out of London, is the world’s largest independent oil trader, trading some 8 million barrels of oil a day.

“Vitol paid bribes to government officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico to win lucrative business contracts and obtain competitive advantages to which they were not fairly entitled,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York said in a statement.

The energy trader will pay the Department of Justice (DOJ) a criminal penalty of $135 million to resolve the probes. Brazilian authorities will receive $45 million from that amount.

Vitol will also pay back the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over $12.7 million in ill-gotten gains, plus $16 million in fines, according to the DOJ statement.

“Vitol is committed to upholding the law and does not tolerate corruption or illegal business practices. As recognised by the authorities, Vitol has cooperated extensively throughout this process,” Vitol CEO Russell Hardy said in a statement.

Brazilian police have for years been investigating several major companies for the alleged use of bribes to win contracts with state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras), as part of the wide-ranging ‘Car Wash’ probe.

In October, police expanded the investigation at Petrobras based in part on secret recordings made by a former executive of Vitol, according to court documents.

Vitol and its co-conspirators paid over $8 million to at least four Petrobras officials between 2005 and 2014, the DOJ said. In an effort to hide the schemes, the company used “sham” consulting agreements, shell companies, and fake invoices with its co-conspirators, who in turn communicated with code names like ‘Batman’, ‘Dolphin’ and ‘Tiger.’

Petrobras said in a statement that it had assisted prosecutors with dozens of investigations into alleged corruption involving employees.

ECUADOR AND MEXICO
Vitol also admitted to bribing or agreeing to pay over $2 million to officials in Ecuador and Mexico in other to secure and retain business there for oil products, according to the DOJ statement.

Prosecutors said the bribes went to employees at Mexico’s state-run Pemex and Ecuadorian state oil company Petroecuador.

Petroecuador and Pemex did not respond to requests for comment.

Brazilian prosecutors announced in late 2018 that they were investigating Petrobras’ oil deals with trading houses, including the world’s biggest oil traders – Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore.

In early 2019, the DOJ opened its own probe into the three company’s dealings in Brazil. The FBI investigated two key Vitol executives who were overseeing the region during those years, including the head of Vitol’s U.S. arm, Michael “Mike” Loya, who retired earlier this year.

Loya did not immediately respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn account.

Trafigura said no charges had been brought against any Trafigura company or its current management. Glencore declined to comment.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared fugitive from justice,"A top Pakistani court on Wednesday declared the country’s ailing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who lives in exile in London, a fugitive from justice after he failed to return home to face additional corruption charges.

The move by the Islamabad High Court comes months after Sharif was given the chance to voluntarily return home. The next court hearing will be held in a week’s time, when the judges will discuss whether to proceed with the hearings and try Sharif in absentia.

Under Pakistan’s legal system, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government can seek Sharif’s extradition from Britain. If Britain accepts such a request, Sharif could be brought back in handcuffs.

The 70-year-old Sharif has been living in self-imposed exile in London after Pakistani authorities in November 2019 temporarily released him on bail amid deteriorating health so that he could travel and seek medical treatment abroad. At the time, another court permitted Sharif to leave the country for four weeks, with the option to extend the time abroad if he was not able to travel afterward.

Sharif’s bail later expired and authorities have already issued his arrest warrants for him.

In 2018, Sharif, who ruled the country three times as an elected prime minister and remains popular at home, was sentenced to seven years in prison for corruption and money laundering. That corruption case was separate from the one that is pending against Sharif. He has also appealed against his conviction and the Islamabad High Court is now to decide how to handle the appeal in Sharif’s absence.

Sharif is also facing criticism for not returning to Pakistan to attend the funeral of his mother, which took lace over the weekend in the eastern city of Lahore. His mother died in London recently.

The former prime minister fell from grace after the country’s Supreme Court ousted him from office over corruption allegations in 2017.

Khan has repeatedly said he wants Sharif brought back to Pakistan for trial.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-pakistani-pm-nawaz-sharif-declared-fugitive-2122231/
Irish authorities probe Wirecard’s Irish arm over alleged €400m fraud,"Gardaí are investigating an alleged €400 million fraud at electronic payments company Wirecard’s Irish arm, the High Court heard on Monday.

The firm, which has its headquarters in Germany, reported in June that €1.9 billion was missing from its accounts, prompting an inquiry that led to the arrest of several group executives.

The High Court in Dublin yesterday confirmed the appointment of Ken Fennell and James Anderson of Deloitte as liquidators to Wirecard UK and Ireland Ltd, the German group’s Irish-registered and based subsidiary. They were appointed as provisional liquidators on October 28th.

Mr Fennell and Mr Anderson submitted a report to the court, showing that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau was investigating whether a Wirecard UK and Ireland escrow account holding up to €405.3 million actually existed.

The account was included in the company’s assets, but the liquidators stated that its value was zero.

Their report shows that the account was meant to have held more than €393 million, with a further €11.8 million due to be lodged to it. “The existence of these funds is under investigation,” Mr Fennell and Mr Anderson noted.

Wirecard report
Their submission shows that a report from Wirecard UK and Ireland Ltd itself to the Garda bureau sparked the investigation.

The company’s report to the Garda concluded that the escrow account never existed. It also stated that a €40 million loan, which the German parent instructed Wirecard UK and Ireland to advance to a business called Ruprecht in December 2019, was fraudulent.

According to the liquidators, the insolvency administrator, lawyer Michael Jaffé, appointed to Wirecard Group in Germany in August, has also questioned whether the cash in the escrow account ever existed.

Wirecard UK and Ireland’s directors resolved to ask the courts to appoint liquidators to the company once they realised these difficulties would leave it unable to pay its debts.

The questions raised over the €400 million account have effectively wiped out most of the Irish company’s current assets. It owes creditors €83 million, €77 million of which is due to other businesses in its group.

The report calculates that Wirecard UK and Ireland Ltd is likely to realise just €6.7 million of current assets originally valued at €527 million.

They estimate that the Irish company will only receive €1.3 million of €76.1 million owed to it by other Wirecard Group entities. Mr Fennell and Mr Anderson also say that the €40 million Ruprecht loan “is likely to be irrecoverable”.

Corporation tax
The parent group’s collapse has extinguished €29.4 million of goodwill attributed to Wirecard UK and Ireland, leaving fixed assets of just €4,000, the estimated resale value of the IT equipment in its Dublin office.

According to the liquidators’ report, “arising from the alleged fraud and overstating of company revenues” the company could be due a refund of €43 million in corporation tax that it has paid.

The liquidators have been discussing the possibility of getting this refund with the Irish company’s directors and its auditors, PKF O’Connor Leddy & Holmes.

They have also asked the parent group and Germany’s financial regulator, BaFin, to release €4.4 million from Wirecard UK and Ireland Ltd accounts held in Germany.

Wirecard UK and Ireland has two main sources of revenue. One is processing transactions for businesses that accept credit card payments when they sell goods or services. The other is providing services to companies that issue prepaid credit cards, such as Vodafone, Orange and Sisalpay.",am,https://fcced.com/irish-probe-wirecard-irish-arm-wirecard-fraud-212201519/
Former Maricopa County official Paul Petersen jailed for running illegal adoption scheme,"A U.S. District judge sentenced former Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen to 74 months in federal prison for perpetrating illegal adoptions in what prosecutors called a “get-rich-quick scheme … hidden behind the shiny veneer of a humanitarian operation.”
The judge also fined Petersen $100,000.

“He subverted what should be a joyous time for everyone into a baby-selling enterprise. The conduct Mr. Petersen engaged in violates public policy. We don’t sell babies. That is the public policy of the United States of America,” U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks said during Petersen’s virtual sentencing hearing Tuesday morning.

Petersen has 14 days to appeal the sentence.

Petersen, who was arrested last year on charges related to human smuggling and Medicare fraud, could face additional time on state charges after he completes his federal sentence.

This summer, Petersen pleaded guilty to charges in Arizona and Utah state courts and to federal charges in the Western District of Arkansas in hopes of combining his sentences and serving them in a federal penitentiary.

The Arizona Attorney General’s Office says it is not party to any agreement to cut the sentence for the former Maricopa County assessor, and it’s unclear whether Utah prosecutors will cut any deals, either.

“The Arizona sentencing agreement is completely devoid of any concurrent language or a global settlement,” Arizona Attorney General’s Office spokesperson Ryan Anderson said. “The attorney general has not agreed to that.”

Petersen is scheduled for sentencing in Utah on Jan. 20 and in Arizona on Jan. 22.

Petersen faces up to 15 years in Utah and about 16.5 years in Arizona.

Brooks said he would recommend that the Utah and Arizona sentences be served concurrently with the federal sentence but noted that he cannot force the state courts to agree with his recommendation.

Before he was sentenced, Petersen read a statement saying it was not his intention to harm anyone and expressing remorse that some women he worked with may have felt that he took advantage of them for his own profit.

“To any (birth mother) that felt misled, slighted, disregarded, disrespected or even coerced, I say, ‘I’m sorry,'” Petersen said.

He also lamented the time he’d have to spend away from his own four children while serving time in prison.

“I tried to make happy families, and in so doing ruined my own,” Petersen said.

How Petersen’s adoption operation worked
Petersen was the elected county assessor in Maricopa County until earlier this year, when he resigned to focus on his criminal defense. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors had attempted to remove him from his post after his October 2019 arrest.

Petersen’s biggest money-making operation was his private adoption business, however.

Virtually all of the adoptions Petersen arranged through his Mesa law office were with birth mothers from the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

Citizens of the Marshall Islands, which is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the Philippines, can travel to the U.S. freely under the Compact of Free Association between the two countries.

In 2003, the compact was amended to forbid women from traveling for adoption purposes.

Petersen in 1998 served a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission in the Marshall Islands, where he learned to speak the language. He quickly started working in the adoption industry when he returned. Prosecutors allege Petersen conducted more than 70 illegal Marshallese adoptions over the course of his career.

According to court records, law enforcement investigation records and paperwork from Petersen’s law office obtained by The Arizona Republic of the USA TODAY Network, Petersen orchestrated his adoption practice this way:

Pregnant women in the Marshall Islands would contact a “fixer” who had contact with Marshallese women in the U.S. that Petersen employed.
These employees would connect a woman with Petersen, who would send money and arrange for the woman to get a passport and fly to the U.S.
The woman often would arrive four to five months before her due date and live in a house Petersen owned or rented in Arizona, Utah or Arkansas.
Petersen would pay the woman about $1,000 a month, minus rent and utilities.
Petersen or his employees would help the woman sign up for Medicaid so the government health care system would cover the cost of the baby’s birth.
He then charged American families about $40,000 to carry out their adoptions.
Once the baby was born and the adoption was complete, he would pay the woman “postpartum money” for one or two months and purchase a flight back to the Marshall Islands or to wherever the woman wanted to go within the United States.
Law enforcement investigators allege that Petersen not only violated the Compact of Free Association by bringing pregnant women to the U.S. for the purpose of adoption — he also broke dozens of other laws related to Medicaid fraud, racketeering and human smuggling.

Marshallese citizens are not eligible for Medicaid unless they have lived in the U.S. for five years. According to state investigators, Petersen and his associates lied about the residency status of birth mothers so they could illegally access the health-care benefits.

Federal judge in Arkansas rips Petersen
The judge blasted Petersen before he announced his sentence.

Brooks appeared to take particular offense with Petersen using his position of trust as a licensed attorney to perpetrate fraud, putting birth mothers and adoptive families at risk.

Though Petersen took responsibility for violating the Compact of Free Association, the judge said Petersen wrote in a letter to the court that he didn’t always realize that he was breaking the law in the moment but now sees he was wrong.

Brooks found that argument to be bogus.

“Mr. Petersen, you knew full well that you don’t falsify information in legal documents filed with the court … and he did repeatedly over numerous years. That is a serious breach of an attorney’s oath, duty and responsibility,” Brooks said. “You knew that lying and making these types of false statements to immigration officials and state court judges is wrong.”

Brooks also brought up a 2006 adoption case in Arizona, where a judge did accuse Petersen of violating the Compact of Free Association and denied an adoption because of it.

“If Mr. Petersen didn’t know it (was illegal) then, he certainly knew it as a result of that case,” Brooks said.

The judge also lambasted Petersen for operating his adoption scheme as “a side hustle for your day job as an elected public official in Maricopa County.”

“That you would be serving the citizens of Arizona while at the same time you’re committing Medicaid fraud … is an abomination,” Brooks said. “While you’re serving the public, you’re ripping them off.”

Brooks also said that he believed Petersen coerced Marshallese women to go through with adoptions by controlling their travel and money while they resided in homes — many of which he owned — in the United States.

The judge said he had received dozens of letters and videos from Petersen’s friends, family members and former clients that presented a very different version of Petersen: A man who loved his family and the Marshallese culture and was only trying to create happy families.

“Mr. Petersen must have led a double life,” Brooks said.

Petersen’s friends, family paint different picture
Petersen’s friend Edward Ableser told the court during the virtual sentencing hearing that he was concerned and shocked to hear the allegations and media portrayal of Petersen after his arrest.

Ableser, a former Arizona lawmaker, said he had known Petersen since the two were in student government in college. He described Petersen as gentle, kind and a “teddy bear” to his children.

He said he adopted a child from China who was abandoned at a subway station and spent the first two years of her life in a crowded orphanage. He said he wished his daughter’s birth mother had received the kind of respect and care Petersen showed the Marshallese birth mothers.

Lars Christensen, who said he had known Petersen since kindergarten, told the court that he and his wife paid Petersen’s $500,000 cash bond the morning after his arrest because they believed in Petersen’s character and knew he was “the kind of person who would never intentionally hurt anyone else.”

“I’m proud to call Paul Petersen one of my dearest friends,” Christensen said.

Petersen’s brother Landon Petersen spoke on behalf of his parents and siblings. He recounted the pain he felt reading the prosecution’s allegations that his brother was a smuggler and controlling over women.

“I know who my brother is,” Landon Petersen said. “I know the prosecution doesn’t know who my brother is.”

Petersen’s parents maintain online that he was forced to take a guilty plea. They have established a website to help raise funds for his defense.

The website contends Petersen spent “20 years doing good” and “facilitated the legally approved adoptions of five hundred children into homes with parents who wanted them.”

The website says Petersen was wrongly accused of defrauding the state’s Medicaid system and indicates he has reimbursed the state. The website says taxpayers should not be forced to pay for Petersen’s prosecution and incarceration.

“The only victims are Paul, his family, and the taxpayers,” according to the website.

As part of his plea agreement, Petersen agreed to pay $679,000 in restitution and fees. That includes $650,000 to the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, $18,000 to the Attorney General’s Office and $11,000 to the adoptive family he overcharged.

The defense website also directs supporters to sign a petition to overturn asset seizure laws in Arizona.",am,https://fcced.com/paul-petersen-jailed-illegal-adoption-scheme-212201444/
Former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan charged in City Hall corruption case,"Former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan and four others have been added to the criminal case alleging a widespread corruption scheme led by former City Councilman Jose Huizar, bringing to nine the number of defendants charged as a result of the federal investigation, according to the updated indictment unsealed Monday.

The racketeering case lodged in Los Angeles federal court accuses Huizar and close associates of illegally obtaining financial benefits from developers who, in exchange, sought favorable treatment on pending real estate development projects.

Huizar, 52, of Boyle Heights, was charged in July in a 34-count indictment that alleged a conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in which Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million in illicit financial benefits. The racketeering charge alleges 402 overt acts that Huizar and his co-conspirators committed to further their criminal enterprise, including bribery, honest services fraud, and money laundering.

The 41-count superseding indictment unsealed Monday adds 50 overt acts to the RICO conspiracy count. The racketeering count now also charges Chan, who formerly was the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety and, more recently, was the city’s deputy mayor of economic development.

Attempts to reach an attorney for Chan were not immediately successful.

Chan, also known as “She Wah Kwong,” 64, of Monterey Park, is charged with RICO conspiracy, bribery, honest services fraud and lying to federal agents.

The four other new defendants in the superseding indictment are:

Wei Huang, 55, a resident of Shenzhen, China, who also maintains a residence in San Marino. The billionaire chairman and president of a global development company headquartered in China faces charges of bribery, honest services fraud and Travel Act violations;
Shen Zhen New World I, LLC, one of Huang’s U.S.-based companies, which acquired the L.A. Grand Hotel downtown in 2011 for $90 million and planned to redevelop it into a 77-story tower, and which is named in the same counts as Huang;
Dae Yong Lee, also known as “David Lee,” 56, of Bel Air, who is a developer with multiple properties in Los Angeles, and who is charged with bribery, honest services fraud and obstruction; and
940 Hill, LLC, a Lee-owned company that purchased a South Hill Street property in downtown Los Angeles in 2008 for $9 million and planned to redevelop it into a mixed-use development, and which is named in the same counts as Lee.
In addition to the RICO conspiracy charge, the indictment charges 14 counts of honest services wire fraud, two counts each of honest services mail fraud and making false statements to federal law enforcement, four counts of traveling interstate in aid of racketeering, nine counts of bribery, five counts of money laundering, and one count each of tax evasion, structuring cash deposits to conceal bribes, making a false statement to a financial institution and alteration of records in a federal investigation. Each of the defendants is charged in various counts.

Huizar, for example, is charged in 34 of the 41 counts.

“The scope of corruption outlined in this indictment is staggering,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna. “As the indictment alleges, Huizar, Chan and their network of associates repeatedly violated the public trust by soliciting and accepting numerous cash bribes and other financial benefits, turning Huizar’s City Council seat into a money-making criminal enterprise.

“Powerful developers, operating through well-connected lobbyists, eagerly participated in the schemes to get preferential treatment for their downtown projects,” Hanna alleged. “This detailed indictment, which lays bare these backroom deals, should prompt a serious discussion as to whether significant reforms are warranted in Los Angeles city government.”

The indictment alleges that Huizar and Chan operated the “CD-14 Enterprise,” named for City Council District 14, which Huizar represented from 2005 until this year.

Other members of the conspiracy were George Esparza, Huizar’s former special assistant, and real estate development consultant George Chiang, each of whom pleaded guilty earlier this year to participating in the RICO conspiracy. The indictment adds overt acts to the RICO conspiracy alleging that CD-14 Enterprise members illegally solicited political contributions by foreign nationals to help maintain the enterprise’s political power.

Among the numerous other corruption allegations, the indictment charges that Huizar illegally accepted more than $800,000 in benefits from Huang, mainly during luxury-laden gambling trips. In addition, at Huizar’s and Chan’s request, and after Huizar had helped save Chan’s city position by helping to prevent a planned merger that would have eliminated Chan’s department, Huang also provided $600,000 in collateral to fund a settlement of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Huizar by a former CD-14 staffer, allegations that threatened his 2015 re-election campaign, according to the indictment.

At the time he allegedly provided those benefits, Huang was planning to redevelop the L.A. Grand Hotel into the tallest tower west of the Mississippi, which would require city approvals and Huizar’s help. When Chan was later interviewed by FBI agents about the lawsuit settlement, he lied about his participation in the secret payment arrangement and about his knowledge of Huang’s “asks” of Huizar, prosecutors allege.

Chan is also charged with multiple counts of bribery and honest services fraud for allegedly agreeing to accept, while he was deputy mayor, more than $100,000 from Chiang for official acts to benefit a project by Chinese developer Shenzhen Hazens. Additionally, Chan is charged with facilitating a bribe agreement in which a Hazens domestic subsidiary, Jia Yuan USA Co. Inc., would make a $100,000 campaign contribution to a Huizar relative running for the CD-14 seat in exchange for Huizar’s votes to approve the project.

Last month, Jia Yuan, which was seeking to redevelop the Los Angeles Luxe City Center Hotel, paid $1,050,000 to resolve the government’s investigation into its conduct related to this case, which included bribery and illegal campaign contributions. Jia Yuan entered into a non-prosecution agreement, agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation, and admitted to providing benefits to Huizar and his associates before Huizar voted to approve the Luxe Hotel project when the matter came before the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee, which Huizar chaired, and the City Council, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

The indictment further alleges that Lee provided $500,000 in cash for Huizar and Esparza in exchange for Huizar’s help in resolving a labor organization appeal on the 940 Hill development project. Court documents allege that Lee provided bags of cash to Justin Jangwoo Kim, a Huizar fundraiser, to deliver to Huizar and Esparza.

Kim admitted to facilitating the bribe from Lee and pleaded guilty to a federal bribery offense. Lee and 940 Hill are also charged with falsifying accounting and tax records to cover up the bribe.

Huizar pleaded not guilty in August to the charges in the initial indictment. He is expected to be arraigned on the superseding indictment on Dec. 7, and is currently set for trial on June 22.

Chan and Lee have been directed to surrender to federal authorities. Chan and Lee are expected to be arraigned on the superseding indictment Tuesday afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles.

940 Hill has been issued a summons to also appear in court on Tuesday. Shen Zhen New World I has been issued a summons to appear Dec. 7. Huang and his counsel have been notified that Huang has been named in the superseding indictment and that the United States government has issued a warrant for his arrest.

The RICO conspiracy, honest services fraud, obstruction and money laundering charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. The charge of making false statements to a financial institution has a maximum 30-year sentence, while the bribery charges each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. The charges of tax evasion, structuring, making false statements to law enforcement, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering carry five-year maximum prison terms.

In addition to Esparza, Chiang and Kim, Morris Goldman, a longtime City Hall lobbyist, pleaded guilty to participating in a bribery scheme in which a developer agreed to make political donations in exchange for Huizar’s support of a project in the city’s Arts District. Goldman is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 23. Esparza is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 8, and sentencing hearings for Chiang and Kim are scheduled for Feb. 22.

In a separate case not tied to Huizar, former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander pleaded guilty in July to charges of scheming to falsify material facts related to trips he took to Las Vegas and Palm Springs, during which he accepted cash and other benefits from a businessperson. Englander’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Jan. 25.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-la-deputy-mayor-raymond-chan-charged-corrupt-1122030/
Businessman Felix Sater to face lawsuit alleging money laundering through Trump Organisation Properties,"A federal judge on Monday partially advanced a lawsuit accusing Russian mafia-tied businessman Felix Sater of laundering millions stolen from Kazakhstan’s BTA Bank through Trump Organization properties.

“In this case, Kazakhstan’s largest city and a Kazakhstani bank seek to recover millions of dollars in stolen funds from those who allegedly helped the culprits launder them,” U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan summarized in a 25-page opinion dismissing only two counts of a five-count complaint. “Felix Sater—the alleged ringleader of the money-laundering operation—along with his associate Daniel Ridloff and several business entities they control, move to dismiss.”

Like Sater, Ridloff was also formerly associated with the Trump Organization. The lawsuit stems from allegations of the systematic looting of Kazakhstan’s largest city Almaty and its bank in 2009.

“The Court emphasizes that the Kazakh entities will need to adduce evidence showing the Sater defendants’ deceptive conduct and their justifiable reliance on that conduct in significantly greater detail to meet their burdens of production and of proof as the case progresses,” Nathan wrote. “However, at this stage, the Court concludes that it is not clear on the face of the complaint that their claims are untimely, and so declines to dismiss any claims on that basis.”

Almaty’s attorney Matthew Schwartz, from the firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, expressed his gratitude to the judge for today’s ruling.

“BTA Bank and the City of Almaty are committed to holding Mukhtar Ablyazov and his co-conspirators responsible for the theft and laundering of billions of dollars, and look forward to proving their case before a jury of New Yorkers,” Schwartz said.

Sater’s counsel Jill Levi, from the firm Todd & Levi, LLP, emphasized that the ruling itself does not contain explicit references to Trump properties.

“We also believe that the remaining claims are teetering on dismissal based upon, among other things, good statute of limitations defenses,” Levi told Law&Crime in an email.

Levi also noted that the judge called the allegations of deceptive conduct “thin.”

The lawsuit that the ruling advances, however, accuses Sater of helping the Almaty mayor’s son Ilyas Khrapunov launder stolen funds in at least five schemes throughout the United States, including through Trump Soho.

“Sater not only met with Ilyas Khrapunov in Trump Tower to discuss laundering the stolen funds, but he also personally arranged meetings between Ilyas and Donald J. Trump to discuss possible investments,” the first amended complaint against Sater states.

According to the lawsuit, there was also a proposal to funnel money through Trump Tower Moscow, before that plan fell apart around the time of the 2016 presidential election.

“Among other proposed investments, Sater conspired with Ilyas to invest the stolen funds to develop a Trump Tower project in Russia, which Sater has claimed would have been a ‘high-rise, high-end development that could make a significant amount of money,’” the lawsuit states.

The plaintiffs do not accuse Trump of wrongdoing.

“The knowing receipt of stolen funds in furtherance of a money-laundering scheme, in the circumstances of this case, amounts to a sufficiently close connection to support a claim for unjust enrichment,” the ruling states. “The Court therefore concludes that the Kazakh entities have stated such a claim.”

Judge Nathan dismissed two counts of fraud and unlawful means conspiracy, but not others alleging unjust enrichment, conversion and money had and received.",am,https://fcced.com/felix-sater-face-lawsuit-money-laundering-trump-11222119/
Hawaii ex-police chief and wife jailed in theft conspiracy scheme,"Katherine and Louis Kealoha, once seen as pillars of Hawaii’s law enforcement community, will spend the next several years in federal prison.

On Monday morning, U.S. District Court Judge J. Michael Seabright sentenced Katherine Kealoha, a former deputy prosecutor for the City and County of Honolulu, to 13 years behind bars for trying to frame her uncle for stealing her mailbox in 2013.

Later that afternoon Seabright ordered her husband, Louis Kealoha, who took part in that scheme as Honolulu’s police chief, to serve a seven-year prison term.

The couple, now estranged, will be forced to pay nearly $700,000 in restitution to their victims, which includes the estate of Katherine Kealoha’s deceased grandmother, Florence Puana.

At least some of that money will come from Louis Kealoha’s Honolulu Police Department pension, which pays him about $9,700 a month.

Seabright described the case as a “grotesque deprivation of civil rights” that harmed an entire community and caused lasting damage to the integrity of the HPD and the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney’s Office.

“The events underlying this case have had a real and measurable impact on our community,” Seabright said. “The conduct of the defendants — all of the defendants — have truly shaken confidence in our governing institutions, most notably HPD.”

The motive behind the frame job was simple — money.

Gerard Puana and his mother, Florence, had filed a lawsuit against Katherine Kealoha in March 2013, alleging that she had bilked them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars years before through a shady reverse mortgage deal and sham investment scheme.

That lawsuit began to uncover a series of financial crimes that the Kealohas had committed, not the least of which was Katherine stealing from her uncle and grandmother to fuel a lavish lifestyle.

The Kealohas used the stolen money for trips to Disneyland, Elton John concert tickets and Maserati car payments.

They also used the funds to pay for Louis Kealoha’s inaugural celebration at the Sheraton Waikiki after he was named Honolulu’s police chief. The bill for the soiree was nearly $25,000.

“They unabashedly used the power given to them to feed their greed,” Seabright said.

A jury convicted the Kealohas and two Honolulu police officers, Derek Hahn and Minh-Hung “Bobby” Nguyen, in June 2019 for trying to execute the Puana frame job and cover-up.

The Kealohas were charged separately for their financial misdeeds, which included accusations that Katherine Kealoha had stolen nearly $160,000 from two children while she was their court-appointed guardian.

Katherine Kealoha was also charged with a series of crimes stemming from allegations she and her brother were running a prescription drug ring and that she used her position as a prosecutor to keep their criminal activity hidden from law enforcement.

Everyone Was Culpable
Monday’s sentencing hearing, which included all three cases, was delayed numerous times due in large part to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In a handwritten letter to Seabright, Kealoha pleaded for leniency, saying that her addiction to painkillers had clouded her judgment and that she was sorry for the pain she had caused.

The Kealohas and their co-defendants are the first to be prosecuted and sentenced as part of a years-long U.S. Justice Department investigation into public corruption and abuse of power in Hawaii government.

Several other high-profile officials, including Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro and former Corporation Counsel Donna Leong have been notified that they are targets of the ongoing criminal probe.

Two Honolulu police officers and others involved in the FBI investigation have been convicted for less serious offenses. Hahn and Nguyen are scheduled for sentencing Tuesday.

On Monday, when Kealoha appeared in court she was wearing a prison jumpsuit, which was issued to her after her bail was revoked last year and she was forced to remain in custody at the Federal Detention Center near the Honolulu airport.

Several members of the Puana family were present, including Gerard, when Kealoha again apologized for trying to frame him.

“My actions are my own and I truly am sorry for them,” Kealoha said. “I ask for forgiveness from my family and from my uncle for all the destruction and devastation that I caused.”

Seabright didn’t give Kealoha the sympathy she was looking for. Instead, he imposed a harsher sentence because she had “perverted justice over and over and over and over again.”

He spent much of Monday’s hearing recounting the evidence against Kealoha and her co-conspirators.

He said it was clear that the former prosecutor had built her wealth — or at least the perception of if — on the back of her elderly grandmother and that she was willing to do anything to protect herself from being caught, even if it meant locking up her own uncle.

Louis Kealoha and the Honolulu Police Department’s Criminal Intelligence Unit, where both Hahn and Nguyen worked, were just as culpable, he said, because there was no way Katherine Kealoha would have been able to do her “dirty work” without them.

“You framed your uncle for a crime that he didn’t commit,” Seabright said. “Let me say that again. You framed your uncle for a crime he never committed. And given that your husband was the chief of police, the task wasn’t difficult. That’s the shock of all this.”

‘He Was Not The Mastermind’
Louis Kealoha, who filed for divorce from Katherine after their guilty verdicts last year, arrived at court wearing an aloha shirt underneath his blue suit.

During his sentencing proceedings, he talked proudly of his 30 year career in law enforcement and said he never expected to find himself facing judgment for a crime he himself had committed.

“In an ordered society trust in public officials is paramount,” Kealoha said. “I have betrayed that trust and for that I am sorry.”

Kealoha and his defense lawyer, Rustam Barbee, also did their best to distance the former police chief from his estranged wife. Barbee read a letter from Kealoha’s mother, Beatrice, in which she said his “only weakness was being truly dedicated to his marriage vows” and that he put too much faith in his wife.

“He was not the mastermind behind these offenses,” Barbee said. “Katherine Kealoha did much of these misdeeds and crimes unknown to him.”

Seabright, a former prosecutor who specialized in white collar crime and public corruption, didn’t buy it. He spent much of his time scolding Kealoha while pointing out the many ways in which he was a necessary part of the conspiracy to frame Puana.

The Criminal Intelligence Unit that conducted 24-hour surveillance on Puana in the lead up to his arrest reported directly to Kealoha, and many of its members, if not all, were handpicked by him.

Seabright also pointed out the fact that Kealoha lied in federal court when he was on the witness stand and asked to identify who he saw in a security video stealing his mailbox. Kealoha said it was Puana despite the fact the man in the video clearly was not Gerard Puana.

“I agree that Katherine was the mastermind behind this,” Seabright said. “But you were right there by her side, right there by her side cheering her on in your position as chief to aid the criminal enterprise that you helped establish.”

Kealoha will not have to report to prison until April 21. Outside of the courthouse, he addressed the media to thank his supporters and said he respected the court’s decision.

A Final Say
Florence Puana died in February at the age of 100, but she still had an opportunity to address the court.

Her daughter Charlotte Mallot, who is Gerard Puana’s sister, spoke at the hearing and read a letter that Florence wrote to Kealoha, her granddaughter, before she died.

Florence Puana said she trusted Kealoha and that she felt betrayed when she was forced to sell her home after Kealoha had tricked her into securing a reverse mortgage and stole much of the money. After filing the lawsuit, she said, the situation worsened and the acrimony ramped up.

“I was humiliated, frustrated and depressed when in retaliation you initiated conservatorship proceedings falsely challenging my mental stability and ability to care for myself,” Florence Puana wrote.

“Throughout the civil trial you manipulated and deceived the court and jury. The combined stress and unthinkable outcome of that trial left me stunned and totally shattered.”

Florence Puana told Kealoha that her actions divided a once close family, and that over the course of nearly a decade she had yet to receive an apology.

“It is now time to own up and ask forgiveness from your God for your offenses and for the anguish, pain and chaos you created in so many, many lives,” she said.

Gerard Puana also addressed the court through a letter read aloud by his attorney Eric Seitz, who has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Kealohas and the city on his behalf. Seitz said his client suffers from severe depression and anxiety after what happened to him, which is one of the reasons he did not want to speak on his own.

“To this day I flinch whenever I see a police car or notice a nearby car or truck and wonder if I’m being followed all over again,” Gerard Puana wrote.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wheat, who was assigned to investigate the Kealohas out of his office in San Diego, gave brief remarks to the media after the couple was sentenced.

Wheat said the fact that the Kealohas are headed to prison closes just one chapter in the ongoing criminal saga, and that for him and his team, “Our work continues.”",am,https://fcced.com/hawaii-ex-police-chief-wife-jailed-theft-112201829/
Pennsylvania attorney gets 6 years in prison for role in $2.7m Ponzi scheme,"An Allentown, Pennsylvania, attorney was sentenced today to 78 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release for his role in a $2.7 million investment fraud scheme that victimized his law clients.

Todd H. Lahr, 60, of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Edward G. Smith of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania who also ordered Lahr to pay $2,106,918.60 in restitution and $273,091 in forfeiture.

Lahr, an attorney licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, and with offices in Allentown, pleaded guilty in April 2020 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, two counts of securities fraud, and four counts of wire fraud.

According to Lahr’s admissions at the plea hearing and sentencing, from 2012 through 2019, Lahr conspired with others to perpetrate a securities fraud scheme targeting his own law clients, which involved the fraudulent sale of the securities of two entities, THL Holdings LLC and Ferran Global Holdings Inc.

Lahr initially sold THL Holdings investments, promising that the money raised would be used to pursue specific business opportunities, including mining operations in Papua New Guinea and the acquisition of the shares of a penny stock.

In reality, the money was used for Lahr’s personal expenses and to make Ponzi scheme payments to prior investors, among other things. Once Lahr realized that he was running out of investor money to pay the THL Holdings investors, he sought investors for a second entity, Ferran.

He told the Ferran investors that their money would be used for business opportunities, including even more mining in Papua New Guinea and residential property leases in Spain and England—but, in fact, these funds were used to repay the prior THL Holdings investors and, again, for Lahr’s personal expenses to fund his lifestyle.  Among these personal expenses were his home mortgage, his child’s school tuition, utility bills, and other personal debt. Total investor losses are estimated to be over $2.7 million.

Even after he was caught, Lahr continued his deception by lying in sworn testimony before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In this testimony, Lahr denied writing checks to his personal accounts from the THL Holdings accounts, when, in fact, he had written at least 25 separate checks to himself over a three-year period.

The FBI investigated this case.  Trial Attorney Philip Trout of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael J. Rinaldi of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania are prosecuting the case.

Swiss authorities probe oil-services firm SBM offshore over bribery allegations,"Oil-services firm SBM Offshore NV is facing an investigation by the Swiss government into bribery allegations that the company said it has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars to resolve in three other countries.

Amsterdam-based SBM Offshore said Monday that three of its subsidiaries had received notice of a probe by Swiss prosecutors who are investigating whether the subsidiaries failed to implement measures to prevent corrupt payments between 2005 and 2012.

The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland confirmed the investigation in a statement.

The Swiss probe underscores the risks posed to companies by the proliferation of anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Even highly coordinated settlements resolving allegations of wrongdoing in multiple countries don’t prevent law enforcement agencies in other countries from opening their own subsequent investigations—sometimes years later.

The latest SBM Offshore probe is related to allegations that it has resolved in the U.S., Brazil and the Netherlands, according to the company. SBM Offshore this month concluded a three-year reporting requirement imposed under a 2017 deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department over bribery violations across three continents, the company said.

In that settlement, SBM Offshore admitted to violating the FCPA by paying more than $180 million in commissions to intermediaries from 1996 to at least 2012, knowing that a portion of the payments would be used to bribe public officials. It agreed to pay $238 million in penalties in the U.S.

Before the U.S. settlement, SBM Offshore in 2014 resolved related bribery allegations with Dutch prosecutors, paying $200 million in disgorged profits and a $40 million fine. It also reached settlements with Brazilian authorities in 2018.

Erik Lagendijk, SBM Offshore’s chief governance and compliance officer, said the company would engage with Swiss public prosecutors for clarification on the latest probes.

“The completion of our reporting to the Department of Justice marks the strength of the control measures the Company put in place,” Mr. Lagendijk said in a statement. “We did not expect this development in Switzerland as Swiss authorities have been involved in the matter from the time of the settlement in the Netherlands in 2014.”

The Swiss Attorney General’s Office on Monday said its investigation was linked to prior criminal proceedings against a former senior SBM Offshore executive. Swiss prosecutors didn’t identify the former executive in the statement. A Swiss court in July found the executive guilty of paying bribes to Angolan officials between 2005 and 2008, according to a court judgment.",am,https://fcced.com/swiss-authorities-probe-sbm-offshore-bribery-11220176/
PR firm MWW sues marketing guru in $10m fraud case,"An alleged Ponzi-scheming public relations exec apparently ensnared actors Megan Fox and Mindy Kaling in his web of deceit, claims a Manhattan firm which says it was duped out of $2.5 million in the con.

Hotshot marketing guru Andrew Garson, who in July 2018 was named to the “Top 40 under 40” list by PR Week Magazine, was indicted on wire fraud charges last year for allegedly conning his bosses at MWW Group to pay debts he owed vendors at a previous company, according to court papers.

But Garson’s money machinations at MWW went even further, the company charges in a $10 million Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit.

The Long Island man allegedly created budgets for “fictitious” marketing campaigns, and incurred debt to talent like Fox and Kaling on projects or budgets MWW hadn’t approved.

The scam left MWW fielding lawsuits and demands for payment the company knew nothing about, including $450,000 from Fox, according to court papers.

In some cases, Garson is accused of making agreements on behalf of MWW that exceeded budgets the company had set, leaving the firm holding the bag for the overage, including $1.75 million to Kaling, who in 2018 starred in an MWW ad campaign for Barefoot Wine, the company claims.

Garson also misappropriated monies working on projects for various advertising clients, including $58,000 from Jack in the Box, $125,000 with Red Lobster and $270,000 from Cox Automotive, MWW charges.

The criminal charges against Garson are pending.",am,https://fcced.com/pr-firm-mww-sues-marketing-guru-fraud-case-11220003/
U.K court freezes $5 billion in assets linked to stolen billions from Kazakhstan’s BTA bank,"A U.K. civil court froze up to $5 billion in assets including stakes in luxury hotels, cash in bank accounts in half a dozen countries and a Burger King franchise, as part of an international legal saga that ensnared Kazakhstan’s richest businessmen, according to court documents.

The Business and Property Courts of England and Wales issued the asset freeze on Nov. 13, based on a petition from Kazakhstan’s state-owned BTA Bank, which has alleged for years that its former bank chairman stole more than $6 billion and laundered it through shell companies around the world. The freeze is among the biggest granted by the court, according to lawyers who work there.

The case is part of a set of civil court disputes involving BTA in the U.S., U.K. and more than a dozen other jurisdictions. Defendants have long maintained BTA’s accusations are false and based on a political vendetta that pits political and business elites against each other in Kazakhstan, an oil- and gas-rich ex-Soviet state.

Both sides have spent tens of millions of dollars on top lawyers and private investigators over more than a decade. BTA alleged that the stolen money ended up in hidden bank accounts and assets around the world including a shopping mall in Cincinnati.

A U.K. court in 2012 ruled in BTA’s favor, issuing a $4.9 billion civil judgment against the former bank chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, and Iliyas Khrapunov, his son-in-law. Mr. Ablyazov refused to engage with the British courts, leading to him being held in contempt. He resides in France.

Messrs. Ablyazov and Khrapunov deny the allegations, according to their lawyers.

U.K. Judge Neil Calver ordered the new asset freeze based on fresh allegations from BTA. The bank said Bulat Utemuratov, a financier, former Kazakhstan government adviser and board member of the International Tennis Federation, worked with 11 other individuals and companies to help hide money stolen from the bank, the court documents showed.

Mr. Utemuratov denied the allegations. “The claim was based on false documents provided by BTA Bank JSC and its lawyers,” said Olga Abdrakhmanova, spokeswoman for Mr. Utemuratov and Verny Capital, one of the defendants in the freezing order, where Mr. Utemuratov is a lead investor. “We will make an application to have this claim discharged.”

A spokeswoman for BTA Bank said it welcomed the court’s decision, but declined to comment further.

The new order seeks to freeze assets including bank accounts at institutions including UBS Group AG UBS -0.34% , Credit Suisse Group AG CS +0.70% , EFG International AG and DBS Group Holdings Ltd., and companies that own stakes in the Ritz-Carlton-branded hotels in Moscow, Vienna and Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. The Burger King franchise of Kazakhstan, owned by a company controlled by Mr. Utermuratov, is also included. Representatives of the banks declined to comment.

Mr. Ablyazov took control of BTA in 2004 after his business partner died in a freak wolf-hunting accident. The bank was later taken over by the Kazakh government, which alleged he and his associates stole billions through a series of fraudulent loans.

A Facebook post under Mr. Ablyazov’s name on Saturday responded to the freezing order, denying the money laundering allegations and saying that a top Kazakh intelligence official was trying to “destroy Utemuratov physically and financially.”

Mr. Khrapunov, who BTA has alleged played a pivotal role in laundering money for Mr. Ablyazov, said in a statement provided by his lawyer that the new allegations were “ridiculous and fictional” and based on “fabricated documents.” He said BTA Bank was bringing the case against Mr. Utemuratov to take him out as a political opponent.

“There is no better way in Kazakhstan to do so than by accusing someone of assisting the regime’s enemy No. 1, Mr. Ablyazov,” Mr. Khrapunov said.

BTA’s focus on Mr. Utemuratov, a high-profile businessman, is the latest twist in a case that brought together powerful players in Kazakhstan’s business and political spheres.

Mr. Ablyazov has said former Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who left office after nearly three decades in power in 2019, persecuted him for his efforts to push democratic reforms in Kazakhstan.

The spokeswoman for Mr. Utemuratov played down local media reports that the businessman was friends with the former president, saying instead they were better described as associates.

Mr. Utemuratov is the world’s 764th richest person with an estimated fortune of $2.9 billion, according to Forbes. The spokeswoman said his actual fortune was now worth $3.2 billion.",am,https://fcced.com/uk-court-freezes-assets-linked-kazakhstan-bank-212201838/
Deutsche Bank accounting chief probed over Wirecard Audit,"Deutsche Bank AG’s top accounting executive, Andreas Loetscher, is being investigated over his role as the auditor of Wirecard AG while he was with his former firm, Ernst & Young, two people familiar with the matter said.

Germany’s accounting regulator, APAS, is looking at his role as part of a review of EY’s auditing, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information isn’t public. Loetscher and three EY auditors are scheduled to testify at a parliamentary committee Thursday about their work for Wirecard. They are expected to invoke legal privilege and not answer any questions about their accounting work.

Loetscher, a two-decade veteran at the accounting firm, oversaw the Wirecard audits for the financial years 2015 through 2017, filings show. He left in 2018 to become chief accounting officer at Deutsche Bank, taking over after the bank struggled for years with legal and regulatory mishaps.

No Evidence
APAS sent a letter to Berlin prosecutors, telling them that the auditors may have committed crimes. The document was forwarded to Munich prosecutors who are now looking into the matter.

EY said there’s no evidence of any criminal acts by its auditors. The firm declined to comment on the APAS probe.

The parliamentary committee on Thursday questioned Alexander Geschonneck, a KPMG auditor who led a special probe that Wirecard itself commissioned last year.

Wirecard sought to obstruct that audit, he told lawmakers. KPMG ultimately uncovered wrongdoing on a huge scale at the company, months before its collapse.

Geschonneck’s testimony “has clearly revealed the strong deficits in the annual audits of Wirecard,” Danyal Bayaz, an opposition politician who’s a member of the parliamentary committee, said in an emailed statement. The KPMG auditor’s statements are “a disastrous report card” for EY, Bayaz said.

Lawmakers in Berlin want to question four former Wirecard auditors, three of whom — Christian Orth, Stefan Heissner and Martin Dahmen– are still with EY; Loetscher is the fourth. The accounting firm is under fire after it signed off on Wirecard’s books without spotting that 1.9 billion euros ($2.3 billion) listed among its assets didn’t exist.

APAS and Deutsche Bank both declined to comment. Loetscher’s lawyer Friedrich Schultehinrichs didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Handelsblatt reported the APAS letter earlier on Thursday.

The electronic payment company filed for insolvency in June, the culmination of a stunning accounting scandal that led to the arrest of its former chief executive Markus Braun and the revelation that over $2 billion on its balance sheet likely didn’t exist. The Wirecard scandal has prompted questions about the role of the auditors and Germany’s financial regulator.",am,https://fcced.com/deutsche-bank-accounting-chief-probed-wirecard-301120137/
Former Nairobi parliamentary aspirant charged with fraud,"A former Nairobi parliamentary aspirant has been charged with defrauding an international investor of over Sh320 million.

Francis Wambugu Mureithi, who unsuccessfully vied for the Embakasi East parliamentary seat on a Jubilee ticket, was indicted for allegedly defrauding an Eritrean national, Mr Haile Menkerios, of the millions in a tender scam.

Wambugu faced seven counts of obtaining money fraudulently, forgery and uttering forged documents.

Between April 26 and November 3, 2016, the politician was accused of obtaining fraudulently $3,208,000 (Sh320,800,000) from Mr Menkerios, pretending he had genuine contracts from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to supply foodstuffs to the Department of Defence (DoD).

Besides the DoD tender, State prosecutor Anderson Gikunda told the court that the accused misrepresented to the investor that he had signed an agreement with Mumias Sugar Company to supply sugar to various enterprises in Nairobi and its environs.

“Wambugu also claimed he had been accorded a business service permit with the Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) to erect a weighbridge in Athi River, a fact he knew to be false,” Mr Gikunda told the court.

The politician allegedly used his company known as Doc Find Company Limited to misrepresent the tender to Mr Menkerios.

Wambugu was further charged with purchasing a Sh75 million parcel of land in Karen allegedly using funds from proceeds of crime.

He was further accused of acquiring stock shares in Ciscos Kenya Limited allegedly using funds he knew were acquired illegally.

Wambugu was further accused of defrauding another investor, Mr Abeba Woldehaimanot Abbay, of Sh25 million by showing a letter of offer signed by Mr ZG Ogendi for the principal secretary MoD for the supply of sand bags for the DoD.

He was further charged with forging MoD Local Purchase Order (LPO) issued to his company to supply 5,000 bags of sugar (50kgs each), 5,000 bags of Mwea Rice (50kgs each), 5,000 bags of beans (90kgs each), 5,000 bags of maize (90kgs each) all worth Sh106 million to Kahawa Barracks.

Five defence lawyers led by Duncan Okatchi told Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku that the criminal case stems from an ongoing commercial case pending at the High Court.

Ms Mutuku freed Wambugu on a cash bail of Sh5 million.

"Sierra Leone’s former president Koroma faces corruption, money laundering allegations","Sierra Leone’s former president Ernest Bai Koroma was interrogated by lawyers acting for the country’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), after the publication of a Government White Paper on the findings of a High Court Judge-led commission of inquiry, into what the SLPP government describes as massive evidence of corruption and money laundering – running into hundreds of millions of dollars by the former APC government of President Ernest Bai Koroma.

Today’s interrogation comes after several weeks of uncertainty as to whether the former president (Photo) will turn up, following reports of a warrant for his arrest issued by the ACC  should the former president continue to refuse to turn up in the capital Freetown for interrogation.

This evening, the ACC published a statement saying that: “The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) wishes to inform the general public that it has on Monday 23rd November 2020, commenced and proceeded with the interview of the former President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, in relation to investigations into allegations of corruption, whilst he was President of the country, from 2007 to 2018.

“The said interview took place at one of the Commission’s secured “Safe Houses”. The interview will continue on another date agreed between the ACC and former President Koroma’s lawyers. In this light, the Commission wishes to reassure the general public of its determination to continue discharging its mandate as provided for in the Anti-Corruption Act No. 12 of 2008 as Amended in 2019.”

But according to reports, today’s interrogation was made possible by the intervention of the British High Commission in Sierra Leone, after supporters of the former president blockaded ACC officials a few months ago in Makeni from meeting the former president at his home to answer questions about allegations of corruption and money laundering whilst he was in power in 2007 to 2018.

Writing on Twitter after today’s interrogation, the former president said: “I have just concluded the much-anticipated interview with the ACC. The chat was conducted smoothly and amicably. I honoured the ACC’s invitation, to demonstrate my unwavering commitment to peace and the rule of law.  It was my commitment to the fight against corruption that led me to strengthen the ACC, making it one of the strongest anti-corruption institutions in Africa, under my tenure.

“Again, I remain unperturbed and ever determined to protect my good name. Profound appreciations to supporters, well-wishers for your solidarity; and thanks to the International Community for facilitating a smooth and peaceful process. I will do everything to protect the peace I helped to build and consolidate.”

There were rumours that the presence of the former president in the capital Freetown, could spark widespread violence on the streets, as supporters of his All People’s Congress Party (APC) were alleged to be planning a widespread protest against the government.

But this afternoon, the executives of the APC urged their supporters and members “to continue to remain calm and abide by the laws of Sierra Leone”.

Writing in a statement published this evening, this is what the APC party said: “The Leadership of the All Peoples Congress (APC), wishes to inform our members, supporters and the public that the Chairman and Leader of our party,  former President of Sierra Leone, Dr Ernest Bai Koroma availed himself today for the much-anticipated interview with the Anti-Corruption Commission.

“The interview was conducted in a respectful, dignified and amicable environment and despite all efforts to complete the interview today, it could not be completed due to time constraints. The former President is cooperating fully and intends to continue in that vein and the interview will continue on a date to be agreed upon by the parties.

“The Chairman and Leader has always insisted on his willingness to be interviewed and his commitment to transparency and accountability and continues to reassure the public of this commitment.

“We urge all members and supporters to continue to remain calm and abide by the laws of Sierra Leone. The former President is not under arrest or facing any constraints. He is in good spirits and extends his thanks and appreciation to his supporters and well-wishers for their support and prayers.”

It is not certain as to when the former president will next meet with officials of the ACC to continue their interrogation.

But sources at the ACC told the Sierra Leone Telegraph that they are working towards an out of court settlement with the former president to get him to pay back ten of millions of dollars alleged to have been stolen from the State.

African Soccer President Ahmad Ahmad gets five-year ban for corruption,"FIFA on Monday barred the top official in African soccer from the sport for five years, upending the leadership of one of its six regional confederations only months before a presidential election and offering a new reminder that corruption continues to plague global soccer even at its most senior levels.

The punishment of the official, Ahmad Ahmad, who had been the president of the Confederation of African Football and a FIFA vice president since 2017, was related to his conduct from 2017 to 2019, according to a statement released by FIFA’s ethics body. Ahmad was found guilty of breaching four separate articles of the organization’s ethics code, its statement said, including abuse of office, misappropriation of funds and rules concerning the offering and acceptance of gifts.

His ban will disqualify him from standing for a new term early next year, but Ahmad escaped with a shorter ban than another African official who was deemed to have violated one of the same rules.

The decision was announced more than a year after FIFA received complaints of wrongdoing by Ahmad, and 17 months after he was arrested and questioned by French investigators about corruption allegations related to an apparel contract. In its statement, FIFA said part of its investigation into Ahmad’s conduct in office was linked to that deal. Ethics investigators also looked into the financing of a pilgrimage trip for a number of African officials to the Saudi Arabian holy city of Mecca.

Ahmad’s ban means five of FIFA’s six global confederations have had to replace leaders accused of ethical violations since 2015, when a sprawling U.S. Department of Justice indictment revealed widespread corruption in the Americas and the Caribbean. FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, swept to power a year later, pledging to rid the organization of the culture of corruption that had stained its image and brought down his predecessor.

Ahmad had been one of the new breed of leaders that arrived in the wake of the scandals. With the backing of Infantino, who spent significant political capital lobbying on behalf of the then little known politician from a soccer backwater, Madagascar, Ahmad ousted Issa Hayatou, a towering figure in African soccer who had ruled the sport on the continent — and wielded great influence as a top FIFA executive — for more than two decades.

But under Ahmad’s leadership, CAF soon plunged into regular bouts of chaos and infighting. The problems peaked in 2019 when Ahmad fired the organization’s most senior administrator, the secretary general Amr Fahmy, and other top executives. Fahmy, who died of cancer this year, was among the officials who had provided FIFA with evidence against Ahmad; the accusations included not only financial misdeeds but claims of sexual harassment made by female staff members and consultants.

Ahmad called the allegations an effort to smear his reputation, and later denied wrongdoing in the French corruption investigation.

Ahmad did not respond to a request for a comment about his ban, which he can appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He is currently on medical leave after contracting the coronavirus.

Ahmad’s departure leaves four candidates to replace him when CAF holds its presidential elections on March 12. Until then, the organization will be run by its senior vice president, Constant Omari of Congo, who faces his own ethics investigation over a television deal that he and Ahmad revised in a way that appeared to have benefited CAF’s broadcast partners at a cost of millions of dollars to African soccer.

Ahmad is also implicated in that investigation and could face further penalties as a result. In addition to his five-year ban, FIFA also fined Ahmed about $220,000.

FIFA ethics investigators are also looking into the conduct of other African officials. Leaked emails and documents have shown how some regional soccer leaders sought to receive payments from CAF to be routed into their private bank accounts instead of through their federations, and an audit completed earlier this year could not account for millions of dollars in development funds.

The 55-page report, completed by consultants from PwC, said “potential elements of mismanagement and possible abuse of power were found in key areas of finance and operations.” It provided yet another reminder of the challenges of reforming the governance of world soccer, which was rocked in 2015 when the United States filed a sweeping indictment that laid out in vivid detail accusations of decades of corruption and wrongdoing by some of the sport’s most senior administrators.

As the leadership crisis in Africa worsened last year, FIFA took the extraordinary step of effectively taking temporary charge of CAF’s management. It sent Fatma Samoura, its secretary general and Infantino’s top deputy, to supervise the organization’s operations at its headquarters in Cairo. That relationship ended abruptly in February, when CAF’s leadership opted against extending FIFA’s presence.

For Infantino, the ban of Ahmad, his onetime ally, is embarrassing, but it also presents an opportunity to find a new and reliable partner in Africa, a region that he has aggressively tried to cultivate.

As well as dispatching Samoura to CAF, he also sent Mario Gallavotti, one of his most trusted advisers, to help restructure operations and plot a path for further development. Last December, Infantino floated the idea of a new 20-team Pan-African club tournament that he said could generate as much as $200 million in annual revenue, a sum that he argued might allow some of Africa’s top clubs to keep top talent in the region. Those plans have appeared to have stalled since CAF told FIFA’s emissaries to leave and the coronavirus crippled global sports.",am,https://fcced.com/african-soccer-president-ahmad-ahmad-gets-ban-2411201633/
Swiss court orders Societe Generale to return $150m of Allen Stanford Ponzi cash,"Societe Generale SA was reprimanded by a Swiss court and ordered to give up $150 million deposited by convicted fraudster Allen Stanford that it had fought for nearly a decade to keep.

The court ruled that Societe Generale failed to do proper due diligence before accepting Stanford’s money. The bank’s Swiss unit had argued that it had acted in good faith and that it had a valid claim to the assets, partly based on a loan to the businessman.

The lender “had to presume that the funds were criminal and should have at least been more careful in view of the clues of money laundering, which it did not do,” a trio of appeals court judges said in an Oct. 16 decision that was released Friday.

The Swiss decision marks an important victory in the Stanford liquidators’ battle to recover money the businessman stashed abroad. The $150 million represents close to half of the $330 million that Stanford was found to have hidden in 29 foreign bank accounts.

Stanford, an Antiguan-American businessman was convicted in 2012 and sentenced to 110 years in prison for running a two decade-long fraud scheme and misappropriating $7 billion to finance his life of luxury in the Caribbean.

The lawyer representing the bank and Societe Generale’s Swiss spokesman both declined to comment on the decision.

Though the bank’s name was redacted from the decision, as is common in Swiss court rulings, the liquidators have said the case revolves around the Paris-based bank.

Grant Thornton, the firm leading the recovery effort, said in a statement that SocGen didn’t appeal the decision within the required time limit, paving the way for the money to be returned to creditors.

“This process has taken 10 years and so we’re delighted this will finally allow for these funds to be returned to the victims,” said Mark McDonald, managing director of Grant Thornton in the British Virgin Islands.

Still, the liquidators in the U.S. and Antigua have a ways to go. By McDonald’s reckoning, they have secured around 10% of the $5 billion in outstanding claims they are seeking.

“It’s too early to mark the scorecard yet and we continue to pursue what will hopefully be significant recoveries,” he said.

By comparison, the Madoff Victim Fund has recovered the equivalent of nearly 74% of claimed losses from 38,000 clients of Bernie Madoff, who’s serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina after pleading guilty to fraud in early 2009.",am,https://fcced.com/swiss-court-orders-societe-generale-return-cash-30111410/
"Former World soccer chiefs Sepp Blatter, Michel Platini faces fraud charge in FIFA corruption case","Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini are facing a more serious charge of fraud after Swiss federal prosecutors intensified a five-year investigation into the pair’s past dealings at FIFA this week.

The open criminal proceedings had been focused on suspected mismanagement and misappropriation, plus an act of forgery by Platini, linked to FIFA paying the French soccer great $2 million with Blatter’s approval in 2011.

Now the investigation has been widened to include suspected fraud.

It follows the former FIFA and UEFA presidents plus witnesses being questioned in recent weeks in Bern.

“(This month), the federal prosecutors’ office informed the parties that, based on the current investigation it is reassessing part of the proceedings,” the Swiss attorney general’s office said on Friday, citing the payment to Platini.

“Since then both Joseph Blatter and Michel Platini are being investigated on suspicion of fraud,” the federal office said in a statement to The Associated Press.

In the Swiss criminal code, fraud seeking personal gain can result in “a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty.”

Charges have yet to be filed in a case opened in 2015 against Blatter, now 84, that was extended six months ago to include Platini.

Platini was the UEFA president and a FIFA vice president in January 2011 when he asked to be paid by soccer’s world body for work done a decade earlier.

The former France captain and coach submitted invoices for uncontracted additional salary as a presidential adviser in Blatter’s first term, from 1998-2002. Platini was paid by FIFA with Blatter’s approval in February 2011.

Both men deny wrongdoing. They have consistently cited a verbal agreement for the money since details of the deal were revealed in September 2015.

Then, Swiss authorities questioned them in a surprise visit to FIFA headquarters in Zurich where its executive committee was meeting.

Both men were provisionally suspended from soccer, then banned, by FIFA’s ethics committee. The Court of Arbitration refused to overturn their sanctions on appeal. Blatter’s six-year ban from soccer runs until next October.

Blatter is also a suspect in a Swiss criminal investigation into a $1 million FIFA loan in 2010 to the Trinidad and Tobago soccer body controlled by now-disgraced former FIFA vice president Jack Warner.

The case ended Platini’s campaign to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in an election held in February 2016. With Platini suspended, UEFA put forward its general secretary Gianni Infantino, who won the vote.

Platini, who served a four-year ban, has long said he declared the money on his Swiss tax return. In 2018 he was cleared of suspicion in a letter from the Swiss federal prosecution office.

The investigation was revived when a different prosecutor, Thomas Hildbrand, took charge of some soccer cases. A previous lead prosecutor in FIFA-related work, he left amid turmoil in the department.

Hildbrand’s name was on the latest letters sent to lawyers on Tuesday, and seen by The AP.",am,https://fcced.com/sepp-blatter-michel-platini-faces-fraud-charges-28112228/
Malta advisory firm Credence linked to multiple tax avoidance probes fined for money laundering breaches,"Corporate services provider Credence, which featured in an extensive European Investigation Collaborations exposé on tax avoidance in Malta, has been fined €261,000 by the Financial Investigation Analysis Unit for breaches of various money laundering obligations.

Credence Corporate Advisory Services is a Maltese law firm which featured in stories on the the existence of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s family’s offshore network, revealed by The Black Sea as part of its reporting on the #MaltaFiles; and for providing corporate services to Russian billionaire Oleg Boyko’s fast loan company, to save millions in tax by remitting profits to Malta.

The FIAU said it found shortcomings in the company’s obligations, specifically failing to identify an ultimate beneficial owner (“UBO”) and other details pertaining to the UBO’s agent; and in six files classified as ‘high’ risk, only three files had had enhanced due dilegence performed.

In another file, it resulted that the client had connections with Iran and Panama, both of which appear on the FATF’s list of high risk and other monitored jurisdictions. Although the company did collect additional documentation on this client and even appointed two in-house directors, these measures were not deemed sufficient as the nature of the activities involved demanded a higher level of o-going monitoring and a better understanding of the economic rationale behind the transactions taking place.

In another file, apart from the fact that the UBO of the entity was featured in adverse media, the company failed to take action to duly understand the activity of the company and mitigate the risks associated with the same.

The FIAU said Credence had failed to gather essential information on why a $30 million loan was necessitated for the company in question, and the nature of the end-customers who recieved the loans, and howthe client would be generating a sufficient return to meet the eventual repayment of the loan.

It also transpired that the UBO of one of the clients was a Politically Exposed Person (“PEP”) who had also featured in adverse media in relation to bribery and corruption. Although Credence as in-house director was a signatory on the client’s bank account, this measure was not considered as sufficient to mitigate the risks of the customer. “No senior management approval was sought despite the UBO being a PEP, and that no supporting documentation in relation to the PEP’s source of wealth and funds were obtained.”

Credence failed to carry out EDD on two high-risk customers, one involved in the mining of precious metals and sale of chemicals, the other in renewable energy; they had no plausible explanation for a $24 million loan and the absorption of another €15.9 million loan.

In another file, the FIAU called to attention a number of loan agreements with Panamanian companies for capital expenditure to a Maltese company that was Credence’s client. Lastly, in another file, the Company did not collect source of wealth information on the settlors of the trust, despite these being classified as PEPs.

In one file, five credit transactions were highlighted, all making reference to a €20 million loan agreement between the UBO of the client and the client company, for the purpose of raising capital. Credence was unable to provide evidence as to how the UBO could sustain such a high-value loan. While €17 million were utilised to purchase a company, Credence did not ascertain that the purchase of such a company actually took place or that the company was actually valued at such amount.

In another file reviewed, three substantial transactions, one of them a debit transaction exceeding $2,500,000, no information was available on this transaction. The FIAU expressed its concern that Credence was dependent on the client’s third-party accountant to provide the information needed, despite the fact Credence also offered directorship services.",am,https://fcced.com/credence-fined-for-money-laundering-breaches-2511202147/
UK watchdog fines FX broker TFS-ICAP for reporting fake trades to customers,"Britain’s financial regulator on Monday fined currency options broker TFS-ICAP 3.44 million pounds ($4.6 million) for routinely reporting fake trades to customers for over seven years.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that between 2008 and 2015, brokers at the firm were telling customers that a trade had occurred at a particular price or quantity when no such trade had actually taken place, a practice known as “printing”.

“Brokers saw printing as being part of the role and one that ‘everyone was doing’,” the FCA said.

“It took place openly on desks, with the motivation of generating business for the firm.”

Printing trades could generate additional revenue and in turn boost pay of brokers, the regulator said.

TFS-ICAP was not able to comment immediately.

The fine, following an investigation that also involved regulators from the United States, would have been five million pounds had TFS-ICAP not agreed to resolve the case, the FCA said.

“The FCA is grateful for the assistance provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States in this investigation,” the watchdog said in a statement.

Since 2018, a senior manager and desk head have left TFS-ICAP, and the composition of its board has changed, the FCA said.

An independent monitor appointed in 2018 has reported no instances of printing.

“This market should take notice that printing, or providing information to clients where the basis for the information is not true, is not in keeping with appropriate standards of market conduct,” said Mark Steward, the FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight.",am,https://fcced.com/uk-watchdog-fines-tfs-icap-fake-trade-2311201854/
Former Bucharest district mayor Tudorache indicted for corruption,"Former Bucharest District 1 mayor Dan Tudorache, an influential member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), was indicted by prosecutors of the National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA) for complicity to influence peddling and money laundering.

The court set a EUR 1 million bail for Tudorache, Economica.net reported. Two other people, including Tudorache’s former wife, were also indicted in this case.

The third person, presented as “a person in Tudorache’s entourage,” was directly involved in the illegal activities. More precisely, this person negotiated a bribe worth 10% of the contracts awarded by the municipality with the companies that won those contracts. In exchange for the money, he promised to intervene to the public clerks in charge of those contracts to make sure they went on smoothly.

However, the prosecutors believe that Tudorache was the one pulling strings, and the other person was the middleman.

During his time in public office (2008-2018), defendant Tudorache allegedly earned disproportionately large sums of money compared to his lawful income, the prosecutors say.

According to the DNA, Tudorache allegedly used his former wife and the housekeeper to cash in the money. The money was spent on trips abroad, jewelry, luxury clothing both from the country and abroad, cars, real estate, private schools, while part of it went on loans to other people or in bank deposits.

Tudorache is the head of the PSD organization in Bucharest’s District 1. He served as a deputy in Parliament before being elected mayor. He officially has no properties.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-bucharest-district-mayor-tudorache-indicted-231121634/
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy stands trial for corruption,"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy went on trial on charges of corruption and influence-peddling in a phone-tapping scandal, a first for the 65-year-old politician who has faced several other judicial investigations since leaving office in 2012.

Sarkozy is being accused of having tried to illegally obtain information from a magistrate about an investigation involving him in 2014.

He stands trial in a Paris court along with his lawyer Thierry Herzog, 65, and the magistrate, Gilbert Azibert, 73.

They face a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m). They deny any wrongdoing.

Hearings are scheduled until December 10.

Sarkozy and Herzog are suspected of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about an investigation into suspected illegal financing of the 2007 presidential campaign by France’s richest woman, L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.

In 2014, Sarkozy and Herzog used secret mobile phones – registered to the alias name of “Paul Bismuth” – to be able to speak privately as they feared their conversations were being tapped.

Sarkozy and Herzog explained that they bought the phones to avoid being targeted by illegal phone tapping. Investigative judges, however, suspect they actually wanted to avoid being tapped by investigators.

Judges have found that discussions between Sarkozy and his lawyer suggested they had knowledge that judicial investigators at the time tapped their conversations on their official phones – the two mentioned “judges listening”.

Sarkozy argued that he never intervened to help Azibert, who never got the job and retired in 2014.

Investigative judges consider that as soon as a deal has been offered, it constitutes a criminal offence even if the promise was not fulfilled.

“This is going to be a very closely watched trial,” said Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris. “Nicolas Sarkozy is someone still very much in the public eye here in France. He has a very widespread support among many people in the conservative party. He tried to run in the last presidential campaign.

“These high-profile cases fuel this sentiment among many French people that many politicians in France simply abuse their positions in power. Nicola Sarkozy for his part has always said that these allegations are untrue and that they are politically motivated.”

Legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the Bettencourt case.

Sarkozy pointed at judicial harassment, accusing judges of breaching lawyer-client privilege via wiretapping.

“I don’t want things that I didn’t do to be held against me. The French need to know… that I’m not a rotten person,” he told news broadcaster BFM earlier this month.

He said he was facing the trial in a “combative” mood.

This is the first time a former president faces trial for corruption in France.

Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money, breach of trust and conflict of interest and given a two-year suspended prison sentence for actions during his time as mayor of Paris before he was president from 1995 to 2007.

Illegal financing claims
Sarkozy’s name has appeared for years in several other judicial investigations.

Allegations, which include illegal financing of his 2007 campaign by the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, cast a shadow over Sarkozy’s comeback attempt for the 2017 presidential election.

After failing to be chosen as candidate by his conservative party, he withdrew from active politics.

Sarkozy remained the most popular figure amid French right-wing voters in recent years. His memoirs, The Time of Storms, published this summer, was a bestseller for weeks.

Sarkozy was handed preliminary charges including “illegal campaign financing” in the Libyan investigation, which has been under way since 2013 and has prompted the wiretapping of his phones.

Earlier this month, French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine retracted his previous statements that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros ($5.9m) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff, Claude Gueant.

Instead, he told news broadcaster BFM and magazine Paris-Match that there was “no Libyan financing”.

Sarkozy said that the truth “finally comes out”.

Meanwhile, the former president will stand another trial in the spring of 2021 along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.

His conservative party and a company named Bygmalion are accused of using a special invoicing system to conceal unauthorised overspending.

They are suspected of having spent 42.8 million euros ($50.7m), almost twice the maximum authorised, to finance the campaign, which ended up in victory for Socialist rival Francois Hollande.",am,https://fcced.com/fmr-french-president-nicolas-sarkozy-corruption-23111403/
Former Croatian PM Ivo Sanader gets 8 years in corruption case,"A Croatian court has sentenced former PM Ivo Sanader to eight years in jail for his role in the so-called ‘Fimi Media’ case, while his former party, the Croatian Democratic Union, was also judged ‘responsible’ for the crime.

Ten years after his juridical procedures first started, Zagreb County Court on Friday sentenced former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, also a former leader of the governing Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, to eight years in jail after finding him guilty in a corruption affair. He may appeal the verdict.

Together with other HDZ officials and entrepreneurs, he was charged in a retrial with illegally financing the HDZ with millions of euros drawn from public firms and enterprises.

Former HDZ treasurer Mladen Barisic was sentenced to two years and 10 months in the same case, while HDZ accountant Branka Pavosevic was sentenced to one year and four months. Former government and HDZ spokesman Ratko Macek was acquitted.

The court concluded that Sanader “organised and connected the second indictee Barisic, the fourth indictee Pavosevic and the late [Nevenka] Jurak [Fimi Media owner] who died during the retrial]”, Trial Chamber President Irena Kvaternik said.

According to the court, each member of the group “had a specific role assigned to them by the organiser, the first indictee Sanader, and each member acted exactly on his orders”.

If the verdict becomes final, Sanader will need to return over 15 million kunas, equal to around 2 million euros, and the HDZ, will need to repay 14.6 million kunas, or almost 2 million euros, plus paying a fine of 3.5 million kunas – equal to some 460,000 euros.

The party, into whose slush fund some of the siphoned money had allegedly ended up, was also judged “responsible” for the crime.

The HDZ, which now runs the government, issued a statement on Friday dismissing “any collective responsibility of party members as well as the connection of the current party leadership with the individual actions that are the subject of this procedure”.

The so-called Fimi Media case, the highest-level corruption case ever prosecuted in Croatia, was named after the firm through which the money was allegedly channelled.

In March 2014, Zagreb County Court found Sanader guilty of abuse of office and corruption, along with two other officials from the HDZ, for unlawfully pumping 10.4 million euros of public funds into the Fimi Media company. The verdict that sentenced Sanader to nine years in prison was overturned in 2015.

Sanader was initially arrested in Austria in December 2010, while on the run from the authorities. He was extradited to Croatia in July 2011.

As president of the centre-right HDZ, he was Prime Minister between December 2003 and July 2009, when he suddenly left the position to his deputy, Jadranka Kosor.

Sanader has been in prison since 2019, serving a sentence in another, the Planinska case, named after the building in Zagreb’s Planinska Street which Sanader’s friend and fellow MP Stjepan Fiolic owned and sold to the government for 80 million kunas, or 10 million euros.

The former Prime Minister has appeals pending for two other cases: for taking a bribe from the Hungarian energy company MOL and for taking illegal fees in talks between Austria’s Hypo Bank and the government between late 1994 and March 1995, during the war in Croatia.

He has been acquitted pending appeal for the sale of electricity from the HEP company at cheaper prices.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-croatian-pm-ivo-sanader-jailed-corruption-1411201549/
Two Czech nationals charged for attempting to fly from London to Dubai with £1.2m in cash,"Two Czech nationals have been charged with money laundering after being busted at Heathrow airport with more than £1.2m stuffed in suitcases, UK Border Force announced today.

Zdenek Kamaryt, 37, and Michala Repperova, 26, were questioned by Border Force officials as they tried to board a flight to Dubai on Sunday morning.

Officers found £1.2m cash in various currencies stuffed in three separate suitcases, and a further £30,000 in two handbags.

The pair were charged with money laundering at Uxbridge Magistrates Court on Tuesday, where they were remanded in custody until their next appearance at Isleworth Crown Court on 10 December.

The arrests mark the second major cash bust at Heathrow airport in just five weeks, after a British woman tried to flee to Dubai from the same airport terminal at the beginning of October.

Tara Hanlon, a 30-year-old woman from Leeds, was stopped at Heathrow’s Terminal 2 on 3 October with £1.9m-worth of banknotes spread across five suitcases.

The discovery marked the largest cash bust at the border so far this year.

Hanlon was arrested alongside a 28-year-old woman, also from Yorkshire, before also being charged with money laundering at Uxbridge Magistrates Court.

It is unclear whether the two cases are related.

Commenting on the latest revelations, Chris Philp, minister for immigration compliance and the courts, said: “This is the second largest individual cash seizure at the border in the space of five weeks and shows that Border Force will not relent in their search for money believed to be connected with criminality.

“Clamping down on the export of undeclared cash from the UK is vital in our fight against organised criminal gangs.”

The National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) has led recent calls for new regulation to ensure businesses’ supervisory systems are able to identify potential money laundering activity, which costs the UK more than £100bn each year.

Following a spate of high-profile money laundering scandals last year, the NECC said the fresh regulation was urgent to clamp down on the criminal money, which “results in a loss of confidence in [the] UK economy which has far reaching consequences for us all”.

Rick Kent of the NECC said: “Virtually all high-end money laundering schemes, and several cash based ones, are facilitated by the abuse of legitimate processes and services.”",am,https://fcced.com/two-czech-nationals-charged-money-laundering-1311202327/
Cayman Islands fines Cainvest Bank over anti-money laundering failures,"The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority has fined Cainvest Bank and Trust Limited $100,000 for failings in the bank’s anti-money laundering practices.

The discretionary fine was for breaches of Cayman’s Anti-Money Laundering Regulations. The financial services regulator said it found instances where the bank had not applied customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence measures; it had not identified beneficial owners; and it had failed to scrutinise certain transactions.

In some cases, the bank had not remediated similar findings from an onsite inspection carried out in 2018.

“This case highlights the importance of licensees having in place effective AML/CFT/PF policies and procedures which are appropriate, effective and fully implemented in order to avoid the risk of money laundering, terrorist financing or proliferation financing,” CIMA said in a public enforcement notice on 10 Nov.

In a statement, Bank Cainvest said the fine related to its “private banking business line which is no longer operational”.

Cainvest is one of only nine banks with a local Class A banking licence.

The bank is headquartered in the Cayman Islands and, at the outset, offered private banking services for family offices, institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals.

The Brazilian family conglomerate Cohab/Aboulafia Group acquired Sul America International Bank in Cayman in 2011 and turned it into Cainvest International Bank. In 2012, the bank listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange.

In 2015, Cainvest bought the Cayman banking operations of corporate services provider Intertrust and changed its name to Cainvest Bank and Trust.

Two years later, Cainvest acquired the securities business of Dartley Bank and Trust in the Bahamas.

Bodden Town West MLA Chris Saunders is a director of Cainvest Bank, according to a 2019 declaration made in the Legislative Assembly’s registry of interests.

Bank Cainvest said the personnel responsible for compliance when the breaches occurred are no longer employed by the bank.

“Our current Compliance Officer, Mrs. Elaine Humphreys, joined the Bank after the breaches set out in the Notice were identified and has been working assiduously to ensure that the Bank is compliant with all relevant Cayman Islands Regulations,” the statement said.

Cainvest said its banking representation and digital banking business lines that are currently offered are in good standing with CIMA and were not linked to the now-defunct private banking business.

“The Bank’s decision to exit from the Private Banking business is in line with our philosophy of prioritising the highest standards of compliance,” Cainvest said.

According to an article published in September by Brazilian weekly magazine Época, Cainvest was mentioned in a recently leaked suspicious activity report filed with the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the US Treasury Department.

One of the documents allegedly linked Cainvest to a US$2.3 million transfer by Unifleisch S/A, a Swiss subsidiary of JBS Group, one of the largest meat producers in the world, which was formerly controlled by Joesley and Wesley Batista, who are linked to a corruption-and-kickback probe in Brazil.

According to Época, the suspicious activity report (SAR) noted the apparent legality of Cainvest’s activity but it flagged the source of funds as suspicious.

Joesley Batista has admitted to bribing more than 1,800 politicians, including three former Brazilian presidents, through the family holding company, J&F Investimentos, which agreed to pay US$3.2 billion in penalties and fines.

A Brazilian Parliamentary Inquiry Committee found that some kickbacks were paid to obtain about US$2 billion in loans and financing for JBS from the Brazilian Social and Economic Development Bank.

There is no indication that CIMA’s enforcement action relates to the transaction mentioned in the SAR or that the transaction itself involved any wrongdoing.

Commenting on the suspicious activity report mentioned in the Brazilian press, the bank said: “Cainvest is not aware of the suspicious activity report filed with FinCen and is a stranger to the allegations made in Época.”

Cainvest added, “We dissociate ourselves entirely from any link to the wrongdoing on the part of the individuals and entities described in [the] article.”",am,https://fcced.com/cayman-islands-fines-cainvest-bank-aml-1311202304/
London solicitor suspended over suspicious money laundering transactions,"A London solicitor handling six-figure international transactions with no experience of ever having done so has been suspended indefinitely.

The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found that Biplab Jumar Poddar, who practised from Hamlet Solicitors LLP, accepted £122,000 from a Chinese client and subsequently paid out £112,000 of those funds to third parties.

Poddar, 47, failed to establish the identity of parties involved in the transaction and relied upon his own supposed personal knowledge and trust. The tribunal found he knew about anti-money laundering regulations but chose to fail to comply with them, failing to ask any searching questions of parties paying or receiving funds into a client bank account.

A so-called financial services agreement sent by the client to prepare the escrow agreement contained ‘very basic’ spelling mistakes, errors and confusing clauses. The tribunal found these mistakes were obvious and would have sounded ‘alarm bells’ to any solicitor who read the document that this had the hallmarks of being dubious.

The tribunal concluded that it appeared Poddar ‘never stopped to consider that the parties had hidden and vest interests and had chosen him, a solicitor with no practical experience in international transactions of high value, as their puppet, and someone who would not ask the searching and probing questions which were required in these circumstances.

‘In essence, he had surrendered his independence and he carried out whatever his client told him to do.’

The tribunal added that his actions were not spontaneous and he pursued a course of action ‘blind to his own lack of expertise’ in such matters. In doing so he breached the general trust the public placed in a solicitor.

Poddar denied allegations made against him. He argued the transactions had not been dubious and he had at all times acted in good faith, in the best interest of his client and with professional independence.

In mitigation, he pointed to his unblemished 10-year career as a solicitor and full co-operation with the SRA.

The tribunal opted not to strike him off but insisted the suspension must allow a ‘period of reflection and insight’ and time for further training. He must pay £26,000 in costs.",am,https://fcced.com/london-solicitor-suspended-overmoney-laundering-11111332/
U.S indicts Venezuelan in kickback scheme linked to PDVSA,"A dual Venezuelan-Italian citizen who controlled multiple companies via U.S. based bank accounts was charged in an indictment returned Tuesday for his role in laundering the proceeds of inflated contracts that were obtained by making bribe payments to officials at Venezuela’s state-owned and state-controlled energy company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Natalino D’Amato, 61, of Venezuela, was charged in an 11-count indictment filed in the Southern District of Florida. D’Amato was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, four counts of international money laundering, three counts of promotional money laundering, and three counts of engaging in transactions involving criminally derived property.

The indictment alleges that, beginning in January 2013 and continuing through  December 2017, D’Amato conspired with others, including officials at joint ventures between PDVSA and various foreign companies in the oil-rich Orinoco belt of Venezuela, to launder the proceeds of an illegal bribery scheme to and from bank accounts located in South Florida.

These joint ventures were majority owned and controlled by PDVSA.  According to the indictment, D’Amato offered and paid bribes to numerous Venezuelan officials who worked at the PDVSA joint ventures in order to obtain highly inflated and lucrative contracts to provide goods and services to the PDVSA joint ventures.

The indictment further alleges that over the course of the conspiracy, companies controlled by D’Amato received approximately $160 million from the PDVSA joint ventures into accounts he controlled in South Florida. According to the charges, D’Amato used a portion of those funds to make payments to or for the benefit of the Venezuelan officials.

The indictment also includes allegations seeking criminal forfeiture of bank accounts involved in the charged offenses, with funds totaling approximately $45 million.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case was investigated by the HSI Miami Field Office and IRS-CI Miami Field Office.  Trial Attorney Alexander Kramer of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Berger of the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Adrienne E. Rosen of the Southern District of Florida is handling asset forfeiture.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Tyler R.

Spokane health clinic owner charged with $5 million Medicaid fraud,"The owner of a health clinic based in Spokane, Washington, is facing charges of theft and money laundering after investigators alleged fraudulent Medicaid billing totaling more than $5 million since 2017.

The Spokesman-Review reports Paul Means, and his firm Abilia Healthcare, were targeted following an audit of its billing by the Washington State Health Care Authority that revealed irregularities. Investigators believe the proceeds of the scheme, which involved billing the state for intensive, in-person examinations when they were conducted over the internet or not at all, were used to buy a $300,000 home on Spokane’s South Hill and several vehicles.

Means, who has been practicing in the state since 2009 and has no evidence of discipline from the Washington Department of Health, declined to comment on the allegations when reached by the newspaper by phone Wednesday. No attorney was listed in court records as of Wednesday.

Investigators from the Washington Attorney General Office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Division have been tracking Means since at least March, according to court records.

They were tipped off by an abnormally large amount of billing codes indicating in-person consultations lasting half an hour or more, many of them at an in-person substance abuse treatment center in Spokane Valley.",am,https://fcced.com/spokane-clinic-owner-charged-medicaid-fraud-27112139/
FirstEnergy credit rating downgraded to “junk” over links to Ohio bribery scandal,"FirstEnergy‘s credit rating has been downgraded to junk status by the three big rating agencies. It’s another blow to the company that has experienced a tumultuous year after being linked to a $61 million alleged racketeering scheme.

Moody’s has downgraded FirstEnergy’s credit rating to Ba1, which puts the large utility company at below investment grade status with all three credit agencies.

In July, federal investigators revealed a bribery scheme that suggested FirstEnergy funneled millions of dollars to a dark money group in order to help Republican Larry Householder get elected as House Speaker and push through a sweeping energy bill that accomplished several things on FirstEnergy’s legislative agenda, including a nuclear power plant bailout.

Since then, a FirstEnergy lobbyist has pleaded guilty to the racketeering charge.

The company says it has created new accountability measures to address these issues.",am,https://fcced.com/firstenergy-credit-rating-lowered-in-wake-of-alleged-bribery-scheme/
Former Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office employee charged in bribes for bond scheme,"A Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office employee has been charged with taking bribes in exchange for fraudulent bonds to release inmates from the parish jail, the U.S. attorney’s office in New Orleans said Tuesday.

Prosecutors charged Sonja Dyson Evans, 58, of Ponchatoula, a supervisor in the criminal records division, and Shawanda Dove, 51, of Amite, with using a mobile phone to carry out unlawful activity. A statement from the U.S. attorney’s office said the scheme ran for a year, ending in January 2017, but did not say how many inmates were released as a result of it.

If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, although maximum penalties in federal court are rare for first offenders.

Prosecutors charged the pair in a bill of information, usually a sign that the defendant has agreed to plead guilty, instead of seeking a grand jury indictment.

The FBI initially launched an investigation into the Sheriff’s Office in March 2017 after authorities intercepted phone calls to the jail over illegal bonds.

At the time, Sheriff Daniel Edwards said no one in a leadership position had been question by authorities, but the FBI questioned other employees while also copying files and computer hard drives as part of the investigation.

Before federal authorities intervened in the case, the Sheriff’s Office had arrested 10 people in connection with an illegal bail-bond operation that allowed several inmates to go free without posting their court-ordered bonds. Two other Tangipahoa Sheriff’s Office employees, Crystal Knight and Latecial Milton, were also arrested.",am,https://fcced.com/ex-tangipahoa-parish-sheriffs-office-bribery-26112022/
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma pleads guilty to fraud and kickback in U.S. opioid crisis probe,"Purdue Pharma LP pleaded guilty to criminal charges over the handling of its addictive prescription painkiller OxyContin, capping a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve an investigation into the drugmaker’s role in the U.S. opioid crisis.

During a court hearing conducted remotely on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in New Jersey, Purdue pleaded guilty to three felonies covering widespread misconduct.

The criminal violations included conspiring to defraud U.S. officials and pay illegal kickbacks to both doctors and an electronic healthcare records vendor called Practice Fusion here, all to help keep opioid prescriptions flowing.

Members of the billionaire Sackler family who own Purdue and previously sat on the company’s board were not part of Tuesday’s court proceedings and have not been criminally charged. They agreed in October to pay a separate $225 million civil penalty for allegedly causing false claims for OxyContin to be made to government healthcare programs such as Medicare. They have denied the allegations.

Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Stephen Ferketic said officials reserved the right to prosecute individuals associated with Purdue, including owners, officers and directors. Sackler family members have said they acted ethically and responsibly while serving on Purdue’s board and were assured the company’s sales and marketing practices complied with legal and regulatory requirements.

Purdue Chairman Steve Miller entered the guilty plea on the company’s behalf and admitted to its criminal conduct under questioning from Ferketic. Of the three criminal counts against Purdue, two were for violations of a federal anti-kickback law while another charged the Stamford, Connecticut-based company with defrauding the United States and violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Purdue’s plea deal carries more than $5.5 billion in penalties, most of which will go unpaid. A $3.54 billion criminal fine is set to be considered alongside trillions of dollars in unsecured claims as part of Purdue’s bankruptcy proceedings.

Purdue agreed to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, with the Justice Department foregoing the rest if the company completes a bankruptcy reorganization dissolving itself and shifting assets to a “public benefit company” or similar entity that steers the $1.775 billion unpaid portion to thousands of U.S. communities suing it over the opioid crisis.

A sentencing imposing those penalties is set to come around the time Purdue receives court approval for a bankruptcy reorganization.

Purdue earlier settled separate Justice Department civil claims, agreeing to a $2.8 billion penalty also expected to receive little financial recovery in the drugmaker’s bankruptcy case.

The plea deal and other related settlements have come under fire from Democrats on Capitol Hill calling for Purdue and its owners to face more severe consequences for their alleged roles in the opioid crisis.

The company reaped more than $30 billion from sales of OxyContin over the years, enriching Sackler family members, according to U.S. and state officials. Since 1999, roughly 450,000 people have died in the United States from opioid-related overdoses, according to U.S. data.

Some two dozen state attorneys general have oppose here the plea deal on the grounds that it effectively endorses a bankruptcy plan they contend would entangle local governments with a public benefit company that continues to sell OxyContin.

Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year here under an onslaught of litigation, has proposed settling thousands of lawsuits in a deal it values at more than $10 billion. That is contingent on donations of opioid reversal and addiction treatment medications it has under development and a $3 billion cash contribution from the Sacklers, who would cede control of Purdue.

In addition to the kickbacks and vendor scheme, between 2007 and 2017, Purdue ignored doctors suspected of improperly prescribing opioids that were flagged by its internal controls, and failed to report OxyContin prescriptions from these physicians to the Drug Enforcement Administration as legally required, according to prosecutors.

A Purdue affiliate in 2007 agreed to plead guilty to misbranding OxyContin in a deal with prosecutors that resulted in about $600 million of penalties.",am,https://fcced.com/purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-fraud-opioid-probe-25112217/
