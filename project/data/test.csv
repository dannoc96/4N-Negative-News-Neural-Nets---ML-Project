931,Caputo concealed Cayman Island offshore firms from Argentine authorities,"By Sandra Crucianelli, Emilia Delfino y From Buenos Aires Times

When Luis Caputo became Finance secretary in 2015, he failed to declare in affidavits lodged with the Anti-Corruption Office (OA) that he had shares in two companies, and that he owned an investment fund management firm based in Miami.

When Finance Minister Luis Caputo became a public servant in 2015, he failed to declare information about his stake in offshore companies that manage hundreds of millions of dollars in tax havens.

The information came to light through documents obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Perfil and the group of local journalists who compose the so-called Argentine “Paradise Papers” team.

From August 2009 to July 2015, Caputo was the major shareholder of the Princess International Group based in the Cayman Islands. He held more than 75 percent of the company’s shares.

However, he failed to include this information in legally-required affidavits for the 2014 financial year, which were presented to Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office (OA) when he became a public servant in December 2015. He also withheld information in 2016 regarding the 2015 financial year. The omission of this kind of information is a crime in Argentina and is punishable with up to two years in prison.

Caputo’s role in the Princess International Group is telling and reasserts how tax havens facilitate the concealment of goods, information and money. By means of his shares in the company, the minister was also the owner of between 50 and 74 percent of another offshore firm, Affinis Partners II, also based in the Cayman Islands, and the owner of Noctua, an investment fund management firm based in Delaware and Miami. The corporate structure of Noctua functioned like a Mamushka doll: a firm that owns another firm that manages another firm.

Aside from concealing information from Argentine authorities, Caputo also denied this information when consulted by the Argentine Paradise Papers team in November last year, following the publication of an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalist (ICIJ) and the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Caputo was consulted again last Friday but continued to deny what Noctua had reported in documents lodged with the United States government.

The shares held by Caputo in these offshore firms again exposes a possible conflict of interest for the minister.

Noctua administers high-risk investment funds in the Cayman Islands, where financial obscurantism reigns. Six months before joining President Mauricio Macri’s Cabinet in December 2015, Caputo had played a key role as a shareholder and manager of these secret investments, which included defaulted Argentine sovereign bonds. Later, in 2016, he was in charge of negotiations with the so-called “vulture funds” that were demanding payment on these defaulted sovereign bonds.

Caputo is also currently Argentina’s representative before the G20, a group of countries whose aims following the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers scandals include reducing the operational capability of tax havens and bringing transparency to the international financial system.

MONEY

In July 2015, when Caputo was a shareholder, Noctua managed investments totalling US $251,296,483, according to documents the same fund management firm lodged with US authorities. The company had between 11 and 25 employees. Its main investment funds were – and are – Alto Global Fund and Argentina Fund, both based in the Cayman Islands.

The majority of the firm’s clients are not from the United States but neither their identities nor nationalities are known. Noctua defines them as “high net worth individuals.” The company also manages, to a lesser extent, money from “pooled investment vehicles”, from “corporations and other businesses” and “trusts.”

Asked by the Argentine Paradise Papers team, the minister again denied his role in the firm: “I was never an owner or a shareholder of Noctua or of Princess, rather I was an adviser, administrator, fiduciary and/or manager. For this reason, I was not required to declare this neither to the AFIP (tax office) nor to the OA, as I have said before.

“Let me reiterate that since December 2015 when I became a public servant I ceased to provide any professional services to said companies,” he added.

In November, the ICIJ investigation had revealed that Caputo was an administrator of Noctua’s investment funds in the Caymans. Now, the documents obtained via a request of information lodged with the SEC reveal much more. Caputo was also the owner of a company that administered secret investments. And he did not declare this to Argentine authorities.

The minister said in November that Noctua managed money from “friends and family” – suggesting its clients could be Argentines – and denied being an owner of Noctua. “I was just an administrator” that advised on investment funds and derived potential clients. “I had no role as a shareholder as far as I am aware. However this is not important because the company, which is not worth anything, is a fund whose worth depends on the portfolio that it is managing,” he said.

PARTNERS

Noctua has had a public face since it was founded in 2009: Martin Guyot, an Argentine who lives and works in Miami, Florida. He is responsible for lodging documents before the SEC. When buying and selling bonds that are traded on the US stock exchange, a Cayman Island fund manager must declare before the SEC what type of investment funds it is managing.

Guyot has been a partner of Caputo’s. The owner of Noctua, Affinis Partners II, had at least two shareholders between 2009 and 2015: Guyot and Princess International Group (Caputo’s offshore firm). What is more, Caputo and Guyot had in their names at least five percent or less of shares in Noctua.

The share structure changed in 2016. In documents lodged with the SEC that year, Caputo no longer appeared as a participant in the companies and control rested in the hands of Guyot, who appeared as an Affinis shareholder.

With no shares in Noctua, Caputo began his role as Finance secretary and negotiated the value of defaulted sovereign debt bonds with holdouts.

In Argentina’s federal courts, two cases have kept a low profile but should deepen the investigation into the connections between Caputo and Cayman Island-based investment funds.

THE INVESTIGATION

The investigation into Minister Caputo and his connections with tax havens began with a set of data from Excel documents created by the law firm Appleby, the main target of the Paradise Paper leaks. The documents, dated 2010 and 2011, contained information about Alto Global Fund, an investment fund based in the Cayman Islands. Caputo appeared as a “manager” of the fund. The administrator of the fund is Noctua, which also manages Argentina Fund, another investment fund that Caputo controlled.

The Argentine ICIJ team found other documents that broadened the investigation. These documents about Noctua were found on a sub-website of the SEC. One of these was the ADV document which requires detailed information about companies and funds registered in the United States.

This first batch of documents from the SEC was dated 2016. But these papers did not mention Caputo. The digital trail did not allow the ICIJ team to obtain documents prior to that date. Logic indicates that the SEC could have more documents on Noctua given that the firm has operated since 2009.

At the end of November, the Argentine team lodged a request for freedom of information. This tool for obtaining public information is available to any person, US or foreign.

The documents reveal Caputo was not only a manager or administrator of investment funds in the Caymans but also the owner of two offshore companies in that jurisdiction through which he possessed the majority stake in Noctua.

644,California Man Pleads Guilty in $6 Million Art Fraud Case,"A California man pleaded guilty in federal court in Florida to charges that he tried to sell more than $6 million in counterfeit art, which he falsely claimed was created by the likes of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, prosecutors said this week.

The man, Philip Righter, 43, forged documentation to support his claims of authenticity for fake paintings, and used the artwork as collateral for loans on which he later defaulted, the U.S. attorney’s office in the Central District of California and prosecutors in Florida said.

He also reported $2.6 million worth of art had been stolen, and falsely claimed to have donated art to a charity, leading to more than $100,000 in tax refunds, the California office said.

Mr. Righter was indicted last year in Florida on counts of wire fraud, mail fraud and aggravated identity theft in efforts to sell forged works by Basquiat and Keith Haring, as well as on other charges. He pleaded guilty on March 12 to one count of mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft in District Court for the Southern District in Florida, a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office there said.",1
881,Couple jailed for laundering £50m,"A couple who ran a diamond trading business have been jailed for laundering about £50m for organised crime gangs in less than two years.

Danny Koort and Jeanette Rosen ran a legitimate diamond-dealing business but used it as cover to launder the money. The pair used code names such as Fiat, Honda, Champagne, Cristal and Caviar to refer to customers in detailed diaries of their deals. Entries for deals from January 2013 to November 2014 suggest they may have laundered up to £53m.

Dutch national Koort, 52, and Rosen, 48, both from East Finchley, north London, were jailed for 11 and 10 years respectively at the Old Bailey following an investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the City of London police.

An accomplice, Andrew Russell, 54, of Ongar in Essex, was also convicted of money laundering and jailed for four years, the NCA said.

Rosen, acting on Koort’s behalf, would take part in street exchanges with couriers to transfer massive sums of cash.

The gang was snared when officers arrested Russell in July 2014 with almost £200,000 in cash in a holdall in his car. He had been under surveillance at a meeting at an Essex hotel where he collected a large bag before going to an Argos shop, buying a holdall and filling it with cash.

Later that day, officers photographed Russell and Rosen meeting in a street, though he did not hand her the money.

She was arrested on 28 November that year on a street in central London when police caught her carrying a bag that contained almost £170,000.

Officers searching her office discovered another €235,000 (£211,000) and around £17,000 in cash, while 10 pay-as-you-go mobile phones were found in her car, nine with code names written on them.

At their home a piece of paper headed “my big friend” had calculations for amounts in sterling and euro, with an outstanding amount of £60,100. There was also a bag of counterfeit notes.

NCA investigator Tony Luhman said: “Koort and Rosen had enormous sums of money going through their books and were clearly doing a lot of business with many organised crime groups.

“Their conviction removes a money laundering facility on which numerous other criminals have depended, and now makes life harder for crooks looking to clean their dirty cash.”

DC Mark Edwards said: “Money launderers are integral to organised crime. Stopping operations like Koort and Rosen’s, where funds were laundered on an industrial scale, inflicts massive damage on serious organised gangs.”",1

A Dublin man has been charged with money laundering offences.

The National Crime Agency said John Gilligan, 66, was arrested on Thursday evening by Border Force officers while attempting to board a flight to Spain at Belfast International Airport.

Officers recovered about 23,000 euros (£20,761) in currency at the scene, it said.

Mr Gilligan appeared at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Friday and was remanded in custody until 4 September.

He is expected to appear before Antrim Magistrates' Court on that date.",1
31,Grace Mugabe faces arrest in Mary Chiwenga Style as shady deals emerge,"Zimbabwe News

Grace Mugabe faces arrest in Mary Chiwenga Style as shady deals emerge. This follows after an audit report into Harare land sales by the commission of Inquiry led by Justice Tendai Uchena that traced land transfers in urban areas since 2005. The others are being accused of selling cooperative stands without authority from the Registrar of Cooperatives, malicious damage to property, as well as subdividing land reserved for recreational activities and schools.

Former First Lady Grace Mugabe, former Cabinet minister Ignatius Chombo and at least 132 people, are facing arrest for allegedly selling State land, corruptly allocating themselves stands, fraud, abuse of cooperative funds and criminal abuse of office.

Other political heavyweights in the crossfire include ex-Local Government permanent secretary Engineer George Mlilo, ex-Cabinet minister Ms Nyasha Chikwinya, businessman Dr Philip Chiyangwa, former Harare South legislator Mr Shadreck Mashayamombe and Mr Nhamo Tutisani.

Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) boss Justice Loice Matanda-Moyo yesterday confirmed the latest developments and said investigations will be starting soon.

“Yes, we were given a copy of the land audit report by the Commission and our general manager (investigations) is liaising with the police so that we know who is doing what to avoid stepping on each other’s toes when investigating.

“We hope investigations will start on Monday after we have agreed on the cases that ZACC and the police will be investigating,” she said.

Grace Mugabe is accused of grabbing stands at Carrick Creach Farm in Harare and transferring ownership into names of her relatives without payment. Some stands at the farm were allegedly allocated to people who were later pushed out by Grace Mugabe, according to the report.

Chombo, according to the report, should also be investigated for allocating himself vast tracts of land on the same farm allegedly registering several stands under three companies without paying. Chombo is also under spotlight for allegedly corruptly facilitating Grace Mugabe’s land grab.

148,Steppe to Soho: How Millions Linked to Kazakhstan Mega-Fraud Case Ended up in Trump Property,"For years, journalists — and reportedly even federal investigators — have pored over U.S. President Donald Trump’s business deals for signs that criminals and their dirty money may have entered his orbit.

The Trump SoHo tower in New York has been one of Trump’s most scrutinized developments. Among other controversies, it has been alleged in court that three condominiums in the building were purchased using funds linked to a massive fraud case in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.

Now, a new investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the Dutch television program Zembla sheds new light on the case.

Using documents never before made public, it reveals exactly how the three million dollars used to purchase the condos found their way to New York. It also appears to support allegations raised in court that the money may be of criminal origin.

Over US$ 30 million from the same tainted source was used to finance other investments in the United States with the help of Felix Sater, a convicted financial fraudster and one-time Trump advisor. Sater’s former company, Bayrock Group, partnered with Trump to build the troubled Trump SoHo.

The documents and interviews provide a detailed account of the money’s winding global trail — via offshore shell companies and a bank linked to terrorism financing — into the United States.

Its origin can be traced to a single stash of roughly $440 million connected to a notorious fraud case involving Kazakhstani billionaire Mukhtar Ablyazov. Last year, the fugitive banker was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison by a Kazakh court on charges that included embezzling billions of dollars from the country’s BTA Bank, which he formerly headed.

If the money is indeed Ablyazov’s, the real estate investments could put those involved, including Sater, in legal jeopardy.

Although not conclusive, the complex offshore trail used to move the money shows “classic red flags for money laundering,” said Richard K. Gordon, the head of the anti-money laundering graduate program at Case Western Reserve University Law School in Cleveland, Ohio.

“If the ultimate source of the money was criminal proceeds, then that makes it a money laundering case,” Gordon said.

That raises a risk, albeit small, of legal trouble for Sater and others linked to the deals, Gordon said. Although the legal bar for prosecution is high, a case could be made against anyone who knowingly conspired to launder the money, or had it end up in their accounts.

Family Ties

The latest revelations appear to prove accusations against Ablyazov and other wealthy Kazakhstanis in two drawn-out civil court cases in New York and California.

The cases — brought by Kazakhstan’s biggest city, Almaty, and BTA Bank — allege that Ablyazov and his relative by marriage, former Almaty mayor Viktor Khrapunov, made investments in real estate and businesses in the United States using stolen money.

Khrapunov, whose stepson, Ilyas, is married to Ablyazov’s daughter, lives in exile. He and his family stand accused of stealing approximately $300 million through corrupt land deals during his time as mayor.

Ilyas and his sister, Elvira Kudryashova, are also defendants in the case.

Lawyers for the accused have denied that the money came from illicit sources, arguing that the financing for the investments had come from another relative by marriage.

Documents filed in court show that, between 2012 and 2014, Ilyas and Elvira were helped with their U.S. investments by Felix Sater, the former Trump advisor, and another former Trump Organization employee, Daniel Ridloff.

The investments include the $1.2 million purchase of a former facility for the mentally disabled in Syracuse, New York, and the purchase of shares in a health kiosk company.

The largest investment facilitated by the two men was the 2013 purchase, for roughly $30 million, of the debt on the Tri-County mall in the suburbs of Cincinnati. They sold their interest in the property for $45 million three months later.

The relationship with the Kazakhstanis appears to have been very profitable for at least one of the two Americans.

A legal dispute saw Sater withhold the Ohio mall sale money from the Khrapunovs. The impasse was only resolved after the Khrapunov firm behind the investment agreed to let him walk away with the majority of the proceeds, according to a document filed by plaintiffs in the New York case in December.

Just why Sater managed to make tens of millions of dollars from the deal is unknown, but the document provides a hint.

According to the document, Sater was granted the settlement after his lawyer sent a letter to a Khrapunov company in October 2013 stating that Ilyas had told him that “that the funds for several of [Khrapunov’s] companies belonged to Mr. Ablyazov.”

The existence of this letter raises the possibility that Sater was fully aware he was helping invest money linked to Ablyazov’s ongoing criminal fraud case.

The Khrapunovs also made other investments worth tens of millions of dollars with no apparent help from Sater and Ridloff. Those deals included Los Angeles property and two hotel and condominium developments in New York.

The 46-story Trump SoHo hotel and condominium tower was developed in part by Sater’s former company, Bayrock, and opened in 2010.

The tower soon proved to be a disappointment, plagued by vacancies. Two of Trump’s children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, reportedly narrowly avoided prosecution after allegations were raised that they tried to boost condominium sales in the building by lying to prospective investors.

The Trump Organization withdrew from the troubled project in 2017 following a slew of negative publicity. The development is reported to be among the business deals being looked into by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The firm behind the tower also has links to the Khrapunovs, showing that Sater has known the family for at least a decade. In 2007, as the Trump SoHo was in development, the family set up a Dutch joint venture with Sater’s Bayrock, called KazBay, aimed at coal mining and power generation in Kazakhstan. Bayrock and the Khrapunovs also partnered on a condominium project in Switzerland the following year.

Elvis Has Bought the Building

Documents presented in court show that much of the money for the U.S. investments came from offshore, largely from accounts at FBME Bank, a now-defunct Tanzania-based financial institution with offices in Russia and Cyprus. The bank was sanctioned by the U.S. government in early 2016 after it was found to be involved in money laundering, terrorism financing, and arms proliferation.

But the exact money trail, and how it connects with Ablyazov’s world, has so far been hidden from public view. The investigation by OCCRP and partners, however, shows for the first time that the money can be traced back to hundreds of millions connected to Ablyazov’s fraud case.

The revelations come from a set of documents first unearthed in the United Kingdom, which has been the center of the protracted global wrangle over the Kazakhstani mogul’s assets.

In 2016, a lawyer for BTA Bank — the Kazakhstani bank defrauded by Ablyazov — disclosed to a U.K. court that a private investigator had approached the bank with what he said was evidence that a Dubai-based offshore financial planner named Eesh Aggarwal had been building and running a network of offshore companies that were laundering the stolen money.

According to the lawyer, the private investigator presented documents taken by what he claimed were “Israeli computer hackers” from Aggarwal’s computer. They revealed, he said, that Aggarwal had worked for Ablyazov’s son-in-law, Ilyas, in building and running a network of offshore companies that funneled hundreds of millions of dollars between FBME accounts.

(The private investigator, Stuart Page, did not respond to emails from a reporter seeking an interview.)

BTA’s own private investigators began following Aggarwal. In mid-June 2016, noticing that he had flown into the United Kingdom, lawyers for the bank sought — and received — an order from a British court to require him to turn over his files.

OCCRP and partners were granted access to the files in late 2017 by a source with direct knowledge of the case. They include correspondence, organizational charts, and loan and debt agreements.

The documents show that Ilyas Khrapunov — under the codename “Elvis” — was the ultimate beneficiary of a complex web of almost a dozen offshore companies and trusts administered by Aggarwal that handled close to $440 million through FBME accounts.

By analyzing documents filed in the New York and California cases, reporters were able to piece together a trail that shows this money was used in part to finance key Khrapunov investments in the United States — including the Trump SoHo apartments and the Ohio mall investment assisted by Sater and Ridloff.

Several of the emails show that Sater was involved in coordinating transfers of millions of dollars to the United States. They also show his relationship with two members of the Khrapunov family. In one email discussing a $3 million transaction, Viktor Khrapunov’s stepdaughter Elvira Kudryashova — the purchaser of the three Trump SoHo apartments — refers to Sater as “my business associate.” Other emails show Ilyas in correspondence with Sater.

Aggarwal hung up when contacted by a reporter. He did not reply to a follow-up email.

Sater did not respond to written questions sent by reporters. Ridloff declined to comment via a lawyer.

Belgian Bucks

Reporters were able to use the documents to trace the money back to its original source: A Belgian businessman who claims to have been repaying an almost half-billion dollar debt to Ablyazov at a time when the fugitive banker was under a freeze order and was frantically hiding his assets from the British courts.

That businessman was Frank Monstrey, an entrepreneur who in 2004 bought Zhaikmunai, a Kazakh oil and gas company that has since gone public in the United Kingdom under the name Nostrum Oil & Gas.

The seized documents show that the entire $440 million that financed Ilyas’ offshore network came from two companies based in British offshore havens that belonged to Monstrey, who has since found himself pulled into Ablyazov’s British case.

The documents show that the companies, called Sartfield and Claremont, paid the money over a period of nearly a year in 2011 and 2012 into Northern Seas Waterage, a Seychelles-registered firm under Ilyas’ ultimate control. Aggarwal, his financial advisor, then filtered the money through the network, some of it eventually into the United States.

Lawyers for BTA managed to convince a British court early last year to freeze Monstrey’s company’s shares in Nostrum Oil & Gas. Just a month after the freeze was granted, Monstrey resigned as Nostrum’s chairman. By the middle of the year, he had reached an out-of-court settlement with BTA to sell his shares in the company to the bank.

In written responses to questions sent by OCCRP and partners, Monstrey strongly denied acting as a front man for Ablyazov’s business interests. Instead, when asked about the nearly $440 million, Monstrey said it was the repayment of a loan he had taken out years before from a Kazakhstani business partner. The debt had then been taken over by Ablyazov after the partner’s death.

“I have never been a proxy for or agent of Ablyazov or those I now know to have been associated with him,” Monstrey said. “I have unwittingly and innocently found myself sucked in to a battle between BTA and Ablyazov/Khrapunov.”

Monstrey declined to comment in response to detailed follow-up questions sent by reporters.

Nostrum declined a request by reporters for comment.

A spokesperson for Ablyazov, Peter Sahlas, declined to answer questions sent by reporters about the transactions and key players such as Monstrey, Sater and the Khrapunovs.

Sahlas wrote that Ablyazov was being persecuted for his opposition to Kazakhstan’s regime, and that his 2017 fraud conviction in the country could not “be considered to have the least amount of credibility given the complete lack of a legitimate legal system in this Central Asian dictatorship.”
The civil cases in the U.K. and U.S. over Ablyazov’s assets were similarly “grounded on questionable or out-of-context evidence from a corrupt country with no rule of law,” Sahlas wrote.

Ilyas Khrapunov did not respond to questions sent by reporters to a spokesman.

BTA did not respond to detailed questions sent by email.

“Catch Me If You Can”

Revelations on the money trail raise the question of whether those involved in bringing the funds to the United States violated anti-money laundering laws.

Although Sater knew the Khrapunov family for half a decade before helping in these deals, any money laundering investigation would have to find evidence he knowingly took part in a conspiracy to launder money with a criminal origin, Case Western Reserve’s Gordon said.

Meanwhile, the messy soap opera continues to wend its way through courts in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

The U.K. Supreme Court ruled in March that Ilyas Khrapunov can be pursued in that country’s courts for allegedly conspiring with Ablyazov in his attempts to conceal his assets.

In New York, too, the younger Khrapunov has run into trouble. In March, a federal judge in the district court hearing the case sanctioned Khrapunov for leaking a transcript of a deposition given by BTA’s current chief.

The judge in the case, Katharine H. Parker, was unconvinced by Khrapunov’s denials.

The judge wrote: “His tone and delivery conveyed his ‘catch me if you can’ attitude and, in this Court’s view, demonstrated his lack of credibility.”

Who’s Who?

Felix Sater

A Russian emigre who grew up in New York, Sater was imprisoned over a 1993 bar fight and convicted a few years later for a mafia-linked stock fraud. He avoided prison in the latter case by agreeing to become an informant for the FBI.

Sater was a co-founder of Bayrock Group, one of the developers behind the Trump SoHo tower. Trump has sought to distance himself from his former business partner, who previously carried business cards identifying himself as a “senior adviser” to the now-US president. Sater was reportedly involved in unsuccessful plans to build a Trump-branded tower in Moscow, as well as a 2017 back-channel scheme with Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to broker a Ukraine peace deal.

Ilyas Khrapunov and Elvira Kudryashova

Ilyas is married to Mukhtar Ablyazov’s daughter, Madina, and oversaw many of the family’s U.S. investments. Under the codename “Elvis,” he was the beneficiary of an offshore network of companies that handled the $440 million linked to Ablyazov that was used in part for these projects.

Khrapunov’s stepdaughter, Elvira, was the beneficial owner of the three apartments in the Trump SoHo developments. She was also the beneficiary of a health kiosk firm, World Health Networks, set up in the United States.

Frank Monstrey

A Belgian businessman with longstanding ties to Kazakhstan. Monstrey invested in the Kazakhstani oil company Zhaikmunai LP in 2004 and until 2017 served as its head. The company was later renamed Nostrum Oil & Gas.

Two firms owned by Monstrey were the source of the $440 million used to finance much of the U.S. investments. Monstrey denies he was a straw man hiding Ablyazov’s assets, and says the money was to repay a debt he had unwittingly come to owe Ablyazov.

97,Eight detained in Gabon anti-corruption crackdown,"Oil-rich Gabon has detained eight people for theft and money-laundering as the government intensifies a crackdown on corruption, the prosecutor for the capital Libreville said on Thursday.

The revived anti-corruption drive has seen a string of top-level arrests in the central African country, as accusations that millions of euros have disappeared from state coffers swirl around top officials.

“Eight people have been placed in preventive detention,” said prosecutor Andre Patrick Roponat, adding that they were accused of “siphoning off public funds and money-laundering.”

The group appeared before a judge on Wednesday along with eight others who were released on bail, Roponat said.

Pro-government newspaper L’Union reported this week that more than 85 billion CFA francs ($142m) have “evaporated” over the past two years from the funds of the Gabon Oil Company.

The current investigations are a follow-up to Operation Mamba – an anti-corruption campaign launched in 2017 by President Ali Bongo, who has been battling serious illness.

The 60-year-old president said last month he was “fiercely determined” to push ahead with the campaign against corruption.

One high-profile political figure embroiled in the affair is Brice Laccruche Alihanga, Bongo’s former cabinet director who took the lead and spoke for the president after he suffered a stroke in 2018.

Laccuruche had held his cabinet post for more than two years but was dismissed on November 7 – at the start of a wave of arrests.

He has announced on social media that he would undertake a new mission for “the president and for Gabon”.

Earlier this week, lawyers told AFP news agency that presidential spokesman Ike Ngouoni and a dozen others were arrested and questioned over their ties to Alihanga.

During his months-long absence abroad for treatment, speculation over Bongo’s fitness surged and the army quashed a brief attempted coup.

Bongo has ruled Gabon since 2009, following the death of his father Omar Bongo, who was in power from 1967.",1
735,Rev. Jeremiah Wright's Daughter Indicted for Alleged Money Laundering,"April 11, 2013 — -- The daughter of Rev. Jeremiah Wright, President Obama's controversial former pastor, has been accused of laundering money in an alleged $1.25 million fraud led by an ex-police chief in Illinois.

Jeri L. Wright, 47, was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday for allegedly accepting $28,000 from former police chief Regina Evans and her husband, ex-police officer Ronald Evans, for Wright's supposed work related to the Evanses' not-for-profit program called We Are Our Brother's Keeper. Approximately $20,000 of that money, however, found its way back into bank accounts controlled by the Evanses, prosecutors said.

According to a release from the Department of Justice, Wright was playing a part in a scheme by the Evanses to misuse a $1.25 million state grant that had been awarded to the not-for-profit program in 2009.

We Are Our Brother's Keeper was supposed to spend the money on training up to 40 participants in bricklaying and electrical work at a Regal Theater also owned by the Evanses, but the indictment alleges that ""little, if any, of the training provided in the grant agreement was ever completed.""

The Evanses have been charged with more than 10 fraud-related counts. In addition to the alleged money laundering, Wright stands accused of making false statements to federal law enforcement officers and lying to a grand jury. If convicted, Wright could face potentially decades in prison.

Regina Evan's attorney has reportedly claimed the couple didn't do anything wrong. Jeri Wright could not immediately be reached for comment.

Rev. Jeremiah Wright: US to Blame for 9/11

In March 2008 ABC News reported inflammatory, anti-American comments made by Rev. Jeremiah Wright during his sermons at Trinity United Church of Christ on Chicago's south side -- sermons long-attended by President Obama in the years before his election.

Among his more controversial comments was his claim that the U.S. was to blame for the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks ""because [of] the stuff we've done overseas.""",1
54,Indian 'hate preacher' Zakir Naik charged with money laundering,"Published

Indian prosecutors have charged controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik with money laundering.

Mr Naik, who lives in exile, is accused of acquiring $28m (£21m) worth of criminal assets, a claim he denies.

Indian authorities have also accused him of spreading hate speech and inciting terrorism.

Mr Naik, 53, promotes a radical form of Islam on the channel Peace TV. It is banned in India but has an estimated 200 million viewers worldwide.

Broadcasting from Dubai, Peace TV is owned by the Islamic Research Foundation, a group headed by Mr Naik.

Other countries have banned the channel - including Bangladesh, where it is accused of inspiring one of the gunmen behind a 2016 cafe attack in Dhaka in which 22 people were killed.

The influence of Zakir Naik

India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), which investigates financial crimes, filed the charges against Mr Naik in a court in Mumbai on Thursday.

It told the court that it had identified assets worth millions of dollars as proceeds of crime.

Mr Naik's ""inflammatory speeches and lectures have inspired and incited a number of Muslim youths in India to commit unlawful activities and terrorist acts"", ED told the court.

The agency has accused him of using funds from ""dubious or suspicious sources"" to buy property in India and finance events where he made ""provocative speeches"". z

Mr Naik says the money was obtained legitimately.

Who is Zakir Naik?

Mr Naik's fundamentalist approach to religion has long been controversial.

Many detained al-Qaeda followers have reportedly told officials that he was a huge influence on them.

He was banned from entering the UK in 2010 for ""unacceptable behaviour"", and because of his speeches, by then-home secretary (and now Prime Minister) Theresa May.

However, it was in July 2016 when he really came to international attention, after a deadly attack on the Holey Artisan cafe in Dhaka.

The Bangladeshi media claimed that one of the gunmen had been inspired by his speeches. Later that month the Bangladeshi government banned Peace TV.

In November 2016, India's counterterrorism agency filed an official complaint against Mr Naik, accusing him of promoting religious hatred and unlawful activity.",1
145,How Trump Corrupted the American Presidency in Every Imaginable Way,"In the final stretch of his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to “drain the swamp” of corruption in our nation's capital. ""I will Make Our Government Honest Again—believe me,"" he tweeted three weeks before Election Day. ""But first, I'm going to have to #DrainTheSwamp in DC.""

To hear him and his circle tell the story, his approach to the presidency was purely virtuous. ""From a business standpoint, is the presidency beneficial?"" Trump’s son Eric asked, rhetorically, in a 2017 Forbes interview. ""If you're talking about existing assets, they're doing amazing. If you're talking about as a whole, we've made sacrifices in order to allow him—and he's made sacrifices in order to allow him—to take the biggest office in the world.""

In mid-October of this year, Trump told reporters that leaving the business world for politics has cost him somewhere between $2 billion and $5 billion. There is no evidence that this math is accurate, and Bloomberg’s most recent estimate of his net worth, $3 billion, is actually up slightly from its 2015 estimate of $2.9 billion. Nevertheless, Trump says, it’s a price he is (hypothetically) happy to pay. “I don’t care,” he continued. “I’m doing this for the country. I’m doing it for the people.”

As it turns out, the same guy who stiffed curtain vendors and cabinet makers, scammed students with the now-defunct Trump University, and engaged in fraudulent tax schemes took a similar tack with the presidency. Throughout his tenure in the White House, Trump has leveraged the powers of his office—and the trappings associated with occupying it—to enrich himself at every opportunity. His properties are now the destinations of choice for anyone seeking to curry his favor, and the American taxpayer is among his businesses’ most dependable sources of income. At the same time, he has learned to abuse those powers to shield himself from accountability for his wrongdoing and attacked, bullied, and fired enemies both real and imagined with the imprimatur of the United States government.

During the Trump presidency, corruption has flourished in previously unthinkable ways, and at such a remarkable rate, that it's almost impossible to keep it all straight—here's what we know so far.

944,Top Macri aide accused of corruption in Argentina,"On 19 February, Argentina’s state news agency Telam confirmed the resignation of Valentín Díaz Gilligan, the deputy secretary of Argentina’s presidency.

Significance: In what is a major embarrassment for President Mauricio Marci, Díaz Gilligan (a close ally of the president) resigned after being accused of concealing US$1.2m in the European principality of Andorra. With calls for finance minister Luis Caputo to similarly step down over his alleged failure to declare his links to off-shore companies, the opposition Frente para la Victoria (FPV, Kirchneristas) has been quick to seize on the scandal.

On 16 February, Argentina’s federal anti-corruption bureau (OA) announced it was launching an investigation into Díaz Gilligan who had been in the post since 2015, following a report by Spanish newspaper El País published the same day, which claimed he hid the money in Andorra between 2012 and 2014. According to El País, the account was opened in 2012 when Díaz Gilligan was advisor to the Buenos Aires municipal government and was active at least until December 2014 at which point Díaz Gilligan had served for a year as director general of tourism promotion for the Buenos Aires town council.

The account was in the name of a British company, Line Action (100% owned by Panamanian company Nashville North Inc), which represents soccer players. At the time, the newspaper reports, Díaz Gilligan was a company shareholder.

The same El País report cited Díaz Gilligan as denying that the money belonged to him, instead claiming that Brazilian-born football agent Francisco Casal, a personal friend, had requested that he deposit the money in Andorra on his behalf.

The OA has announced that it has requested information from the financial information unit and from the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA). Díaz Gilligan’s resignation followed pressure from across the political spectrum, including the ruling centre-right Cambiemos coalition which had been calling for President Macri to suspend him at least on a temporary basis while his situation was being clarified.

Díaz Gilligan is not the only top official under pressure over corruption. Finance Minister Luis Caputo has also come under scrutiny after the OA announced on 15 February that it had requested information from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following reports that Caputo had failed to declare his connections to offshore companies in the Cayman Islands when he took office in December 2015.

Caputo’s alleged links to these off-shore companies previously emerged in November 2017 with the so-called ‘Paradise Papers’ - a huge data leak by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

Looking Ahead: The FPV has been quick to seize on the scandal involving Díaz Gilligan, filing an appeal before the judiciary accusing him of money laundering and malicious omission for failing to disclose the funds before the OA.

440,Sheldon Adelson Violated Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,"The gambling mogul is self-reporting violations of the law against bribing foreign officials.

Sheldon Adelson, the gambling mogul who became famous by backing lunatics with his fortune last election cycle, is self-reporting violations of the law against bribing foreign officials.

NYT (“ In Filing, Casino Operator Admits Likely Violation of an Antibribery Law “):

The Las Vegas Sands Corporation, an international gambling empire controlled by the billionaire Sheldon G. Adelson, has informed the Securities and Exchange Commission that it likely violated a federal law against bribing foreign officials.

In its annual regulatory report published by the commission on Friday, the Sands reported that its audit committee and independent accountants had determined that “there were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions” of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

The disclosure comes amid an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the company’s business activities in China.

It is the company’s first public acknowledgment of possible wrongdoing. Ron Reese, a spokesman for the Sands, declined to comment further.

The company’s activities in mainland China, including an attempt to set up a trade center in Beijing and create a sponsored basketball team, as well as tens of millions of dollars in payments the Sands made through a Chinese intermediary, had become a focus of the federal investigation, according to reporting by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal in August.

In its filing, the Sands said that it did not believe the findings would have material impact on its financial statements, or that they warranted revisions in its past statements. The company said that it was too early to determine whether the investigation would result in any losses. “The company is cooperating with all investigations,” the statement said.

The Sands’ activities in China came under the scrutiny of federal investigators after 2010, when Steven C. Jacobs, the former president of the company’s operations in Macau, filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit in which he charged that he had been pressured to exercise improper leverage against government officials. He also accused the company of turning a blind eye toward Chinese organized crime figures operating in its casinos.

Mr. Adelson began his push into China over a decade ago, after the authorities began offering a limited number of gambling licenses in Macau, a semiautonomous archipelago in the Pearl River Delta that is the only place in the country where casino gambling is legal.

But as with many lucrative business spheres in China, the gambling industry on Macau is laced with corruption. Companies must rely on the good will of Chinese officials to secure licenses and contracts. Officials control even the flow of visitors, many of whom come on government-run junkets from the mainland.

As he maneuvered to enter Macau’s gambling market, Mr. Adelson, who is well known in the United States for his financial and political clout, became enmeshed in often intertwining political and business dealings. At one point he reportedly intervened on behalf of the Chinese government to help stall a House resolution condemning the country’s bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics on the basis of its human rights record.

The FCPA, which Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1977, is well-intentioned. As Transparency International explains,

Corruption destroys lives and communities, and undermines countries and institutions. It generates popular anger that threatens to further destabilise societies and exacerbate violent conflicts.

The Corruption Perceptions Index scores countries on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). While no country has a perfect score, two-thirds of countries score below 50, indicating a serious corruption problem.

Corruption translates into human suffering, with poor families being extorted for bribes to see doctors or to get access to clean drinking water. It leads to failure in the delivery of basic services like education or healthcare. It derails the building of essential infrastructure, as corrupt leaders skim funds.

Corruption amounts to a dirty tax, and the poor and most vulnerable are its primary victims.

Additionally, not only do American businesses bribing foreign officials potentially compromise US government interests but they create an unlevel playing field for their American competitors; much like steroids in sports, it essentially forces everybody to cheat.

Alas, what we consider “corruption” is simply the cost of doing business in so many countries. Low level officials, especially, often expect payoffs in much the same way low level service employees in the United States expect tips. So, FCPA not only swims against local tide but puts US businesses at a competitive disadvantage against non-US competitors not so constrained. Which, naturally, encourages them to find creative ways to play the local game without technical violation of FCPA.

Transparency International publishes an annual Corruption Perceptions Index. Here’s the world map view:

An interactive version is available at their site. The United States is the 19th least corrupt country in the survey, ranking just below the United Kingdom and just above Chile.

Additionally, while our system is by no means corrupt in an world comparative sense, it’s rather amusing that Adelson is allowed to spend unlimited funds influencing US public policy through lobbying and direct contributions to political campaigns but could potentially face criminal sanctions for greasing the palms of officials in China.",1
470,Brazil Construction Giant Admits to Massive Bribe Scheme,"Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht and its affiliate Braskem agreed to pay $3.5 billion in fines after pleading guilty to bribery charges, revealing the magnitude of the international scheme as well as the United States’ growing involvement in prosecuting international corruption.

The joint investigation by authorities in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland unveiled a “massive and unparalleled bribery and bid-rigging scheme” initiated in 2001 that was institutionalized within the company over the years, according to a December 21, US Justice Department press release.

US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sung-Hee Suh said that “Odebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit — a ‘Department of Bribery,’ so to speak — that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents.”

The bribery unit grew such that it was officially baptized the “Division of Structured Operations” by 2006, and reported directly to the conglomerate’s top executives. By the pleading parties’ own admission, this unit transferred approximately $788 million to government officials and political parties in twelve countries in return for public contracts, favorable legislation and preferential prices on acquired material, according to the criminal information document that charged the Odebrecht conglomerate.

According to the US Justice Department, the bribery unit “utilized an entirely separate and off-book communications system, which allowed members of the Division of Structured Operations to communicate with one another and with outside financial operators and other co-conspirators about the bribes via secure emails and instant messages, using codenames and passwords.”

No instances of corrupt US officials have been raised in the case, but the unit used US bank accounts at times to transfer the illegal funds. Prosecutors used this fact to establish the US courts’ claim of jurisdiction in a case involving foreign companies and officials.

Odebrecht agreed that an appropriate fine would be $4.5 billion, an amount Bloomberg described as “the largest corruption penalty ever levied by global authorities.” However, the company argued that it was only able to pay $2.6 billion. The final amount the company will pay will be decided at an April court hearing.

Eighty percent of the penalty will be paid to Brazil and the remaining 20 percent will be equally divided between Switzerland and the United States. For its part, Braskem has agreed to pay around $1 billion, of which 70 percent will go to Brazil, while the two other countries will obtain 15 percent each.

InSight Crime Analysis

These latest revelations linked to the ongoing Petrobras scandal indicate that corruption at Odebrecht was not only widespread, but institutionalized as part of the company’s operations. This shows how ingrained the practice of bribery was at the company, and also how commonplace corruption of this kind is throughout Latin America. Apparently, Odebrecht decided that creating a criminal structure to buy friendly treatment from officials was more efficient than trying to compete with other firms without greasing the wheels of bureaucracy through corruption.

This case also highlights the United States’ deepening involvement in prosecuting international cases of corruption with only a tenuous nexus to the United States itself. This dynamic was previously illustrated by the FIFA corruption scandal, the investigation into the state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PdVSA), and the various probes into the ties between Honduran elites and organized crime.",1
742,Drug kingpin 'Chino Antrax' who worked for El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel is missing just two months after being released from California prison on probation,"A lethal enforcer for El Chapo 's Sinaloa drug cartel has gone missing in California, two months after he was released from prison on probation.

Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa - better known as 'Chino Antrax' - was released from Metropolitan Correctional Center San Diego on March 3 after serving nearly seven years behind bars for drug smuggling.

Arechiga Gamboa, 39, was reported missing last Wednesday when a probation officer paid a visit to his house in Southern California and discovered it was empty.

A warrant is now out for his arrest, and authorities are 'recommending nine more months behind bars if he is caught', according to The San Diego Union Tribune.

The San Diego Union Tribune reports that Arechiga Gamboa may have fled back to his homeland of Mexico.

Arechiga Gamboa was arrested in December 2013 - less than two months before the Sinaloa cartel's top leader, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, was captured.

In 2015 Arechiga Gamboa plead guilty to participating in cocaine and marijuana shipments from Mexico to the US. He also admitted to facilitating violent activities for the Sinaloa cartel.

At the time, the prosecutors trumpeted the fact that he was being tried on US soil.

'Chino Antrax is one of the highest-ranking Sinaloa cartel kingpins ever prosecuted in the United States,' Laura Duffy, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, stated in 2015.

However, Arechiga Gamboa was only sentenced in December 2019.

While initially facing life in prison , he was only sentenced to seven years and three months behind bars - most of which he had already served.

According to Mexican media, he was one of the two leaders of a group of hit men who call themselves the 'Anthrax'.

The group is blamed for a series of murders, including the killings of three men who were hung off a bridge in 2011, that were seen as revenge after one of their leaders was murdered.

The Anthrax also helped the Sinaloa organization as it engaged in a bloody war with the Beltran Leyva cartel, when the latter decided to splinter in 2008.

Several folk songs, known as narcocorridos, mention 'El Chino Antrax' as an elegant and fit man with a taste for sports cars, yachts and Champagne.

Prior to his arrest, Arechiga Gamboa used social media to post images of himself, with his face blurred out, with beautiful women, gold-plated firearms, Italian sports cars and other luxuries in locations all over the world.

He was arrested in a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigation that began in 2011 by targeting a small drug-dealing ring in the San Diego suburbs of Chula Vista and National City, before it reached top leaders through the use of more than 200 wiretaps.

Meanwhile, Sinaloa's former leader, Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán, is currently serving life in prison inside ADX Florence - the nation's most secure supermax prison.

He was considered to have been the most powerful drug lord in the world prior to his capture in 2014.",1
372,Former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun arrested,"Markus Braun, the former CEO of the German payment services provider Wirecard, has been arrested, public prosecutors in Munich confirmed on Tuesday, saying that he had turned himself in on Monday evening.

A statement from the prosecutors' office said Braun had been detained on suspicion of inflating the company's balance sheet and revenues to make it appear stronger and more attractive for investors and customers. Three other managers are also under investigation.

An administrative court said the Austrian was released after setting his bail at €5 million ($5.67 million).

Braun resigned last week as CEO of Wirecard after an audit revealed billions of euros in discrepancies on the company’s budget sheet, causing Wirecard share values to plummet.

Missing €1.9 billion probably 'does not exist'

On Monday, Wirecard said its management board ""assesses on the basis of further examination that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) do not exist.''

The financial service provider also announced the firing of its chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, who had been suspended from the management board last week.

Marsalek had been in charge of overseeing daily operations including in Southeast Asia, where the possible fraud occurred, according to German news agency dpa.

Wirecard AG — once a darling of the growing financial technology sector — has fallen sharply from grace since last year when a series of reports in the Financial Times uncovered accounting irregularities in its Asian operations.",1

835,Jailed: Romford businessman involved in 'callous' boiler room scam!,"Jailed: Romford businessman involved in 'callous' boiler room scam which conned elderly people out of £3million

A businessman involved in a ""highly sophisticated"" boiler room scam has been jailed for seven years today.

Muhammad Tanveer, of South Street, Romford was one of four men jailed for money laundering offences at Southwark Crown Court on Friday, April 26.

Tanveer, 30, was part of a group of eight who ran an elaborate scam from 2014 until 2016, conning more than 50 people out of £1.6million by convincing them to invest in fake companies.

In particular, they would target elderly and often vulnerable individuals, with some people being scammed by the group more than once.

Judge Joanna Korner told the court: “The reason this fraud was particularly unpleasant was that part of it was aimed at many people who had already been defrauded.

“The frauds were highly sophisticated.”

A boiler room fraud sees criminals make cold calls or emails to people pretending to be from an established and legitimate company, persuading them to invest in what are in fact completely worthless or non-existent stocks. Often high pressured sales tactics are used, which is why they're described as boiler room.

The scam saw more than 50 people lose out to the con, with one victim, aged 83, losing just over £1m.

Another victim, who lost around £300,000, said in an impact statement to the police: “The financial loss has had a significant impact on my family and a longer term impact on not being able to provide for my family and children.”

Another told the police he couldn't sleep and had lost weight because of all the stress.

Judge Korner identified Tanveer as playing a leading role in the scam. He helped set up the companies used for the fraud, made arrangements for the websites and logos, and had direct contact with some of the investors.

“During the course of the evidence, [Tanveer] told lie after lie,” said judge Korner.

“Some of which were particularly outrageous. Even after being convicted in the first trial he declined to plead guilty.”

In addition to being jailed for a maximum of seven years, Tanveer was disqualified from acting as a director of a company for 10 years.

He was jailed for four years and eight months and disqualified from acting as the director of a company for seven years.

Richardson was given a suspended sentence of two years for a two year period and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and Mandy Cross, who used some of the money she gained from the scam to holiday in Mexico, was given a suspended sentence of 12 months for two years and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk, also played a key role in the scam. He had just been freed from prison for previous fraud convictions when he met Tanveer.

The court found that he was at high risk of reoffending and he was jailed for six years.

Ryan Weston, 27, from Wisbech, was jailed for a total of three years and six months after pleading guilty to money laundering at a trial on Monday, April 8.

Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk, pleaded guilty to money laundering at an earlier court date and was given a 20 months suspended sentence for two years, ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from being a director of a company for five years.

Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay, was given a 15 months suspended sentence for two years and disqualified from acting as a director of a company for five years.

Judge Korner said: “These types of boiler room fraud are both pervasive, pernicious and mean and they produce large rewards for those who commit them.

“No one who reads or watches the media can fail to be aware that, notwithstanding the organisations set up by the police, only a tiny proportion of fraud receives investigations.

“I have no doubt that police resources are struggling. It's imperative that more time and resources are devoted not just to cybercrime but also these type of fraud of cases.”

Alistair Dickson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: “This was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didn't exist.

“Common to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable.

“Persuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told.",1
826,U.S. Treasury targets ‘Los Cachiros’ in Honduras,"The United States government levied sanctions on Sept. 19 against seven individuals and five businesses linked to Los Cachiros, a Honduran-based narco-trafficking organization, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

Brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who are the gang’s alleged leaders, were designated as narco-traffickers along with several of their family members who allegedly play a role in Los Cachiros’ international narco-trafficking. Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga López (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jirón (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros) also were sanctioned.

“Los Cachiros is a violent drug-trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,” U.S. Treasury Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin said in a prepared statement. “Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are – drug traffickers and money launderers.”

The sanctioned Honduran businesses, which are owned or overseen by the Maradiaga brothers or their relatives include Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguán, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turísticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park). The businesses are suspected of laundering Los Cachiros’ money.

The sanctions, established under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, freeze any assets held by the individuals or businesses and make it illegal for any U.S. entity or citizen to conduct financial or commercial transactions with them.

Los Cachiros coordinates the trafficking of narcotics for Colombian and Mexican cartels and organized crime groups. The gang reportedly controls 90% of illegal airstrips in the Central American nation. Nearly 90% of the cocaine that reaches the United States comes through Mexico and Central America, according the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board.

In August 2012, the Nicaraguan government charged Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jirón – Rivera Maradiaga’s suspected associate – with conspiracy to traffic narcotics internationally, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics and organized crime. Lira Jirón was taken into custody by Nicaraguan authorities later that month.

Szubin thanked the Honduran government, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the U.S. State Department for their support and cooperation.

“Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers,” DEA Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight said in a prepared statement. “We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes.”

The U.S. Treasury has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to US$1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties.

Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines of up to US$5 million, while fines for corporations may reach US$10 million. Individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines.",1
733,"Convicted fraudster who owes taxpayers more than £65m has been living it up in Dubai, Bermuda and the Maldives despite claiming to be too poor to pay back his criminal profits","A convicted fraudster who owes more than £65million to the taxpayer has been living a luxury lifestyle around the world despite claiming to be too poor to pay back the profits from his criminal deeds.

Gerald Smith, 52, has taken more than 360 flights in the past five years, spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on private jets and first-class travel to destinations including Bermuda, the Maldives and Dubai.

Smith was jailed for eight years in 2006 for stealing £35million from computer software company Izodia and was ordered to pay back £41million a year later, which has since risen to £65million due to interest charges.

At the time of his conviction, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said the fraud was one of the largest they had ever dealt with.

Smith is currently battling efforts to send him back to jail over the unpaid debt, claiming his wealth is tied up in assets that he cannot access.

But the SFO say he is living a 'conspicuously lavish lifestyle' and have submitted court documents containing details of his expensive flights and also say he has been staying in luxury hotels running up bills of £10,000.

According to the Evening Standard, the documents state during one year alone he made 105 flights on private jets at a cost of £980,000 and spent another £275,000 on British Airways trips over the same period.

They have been handed in at Folkestone Magistrates' Court, where the confiscation order process is being overseen.

The files also detail a range of assets prosecutors believe Smith bought with his ill-gotten gains, including a £12million mansion in Jersey where his ex-wife lives, a block of flats in a mansion in Holborn, two £5million villas in Majorca and a ski lodge in Whistler, Canada.

At his hearing in 2006 the court heard the qualified general practitioner, who has two daughters, used the £35million to buy a yacht and pay off interest on multi-million-pound business loans.

Many of the millions he swindled from software firm Izodia, based in Slough, Berks, should have gone to City institutions controlling pension funds.

As well as being jailed he was banned from being a company director for 15 years.

The SFO now want him to be sent back to jail for another eight year sentence unless he pays the bill.",1

The FBI had been seeking Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" for seven years and had him on the Most Wanted list.

The FBI accused him of being responsible for shipping ""multiple tons of cocaine"" into the United States and called him ""one of the principal leaders of the Colombian North Valley drug cartel,"" which it said is ""the most powerful and violent drug trafficking organization in Colombia.""

The cartel reportedly relies on right-wing paramilitary and left-wing rebel groups, the FBI said on its Web site, which had not been updated Monday evening.

Montoya was responsible for as much as 70 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States and Europe and his organization ordered 1,500 assassinations, Santos said. Watch Montoya being escorted under heavy guard »

The capture was the culmination of a plan months in the making, Santos said. Plans revved up three days ago, when informants told authorities that Montoya was in the town of Salsa in the department of El Valle, he said.

On Sunday, intelligence narrowed his whereabouts to the Hacienda Pital, said Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe. ""With this information, we mounted the operation,"" he said. ""This morning, at 4:30 a.m., we got the green light.""

Forty members of the army's special forces were flown past Montoya Sanchez's phalanx of security guards, and other soldiers were moved to other locations to distract them, he said.

By 6:20 a.m. a commando team had surrounded the house as other troops stayed about 400 meters away.

Inside they found three women, including Montoya Sanchez's mother, and two men, one of them his uncle. They also found his wallet and cell phone, but Montoya Sanchez was nowhere to be found, the general said.

But a soldier searching outside the house saw leaves of a bush move and found the suspect hiding, clad in his underwear, Montoya Uribe said.

The heavy-set man was taken to a helicopter and ferried to the capital, where authorities paraded him -- now wearing a black T-shirt and khaki pants, his hands bound before him -- before reporters.

Asked if he wanted to make a statement, he said he did not.

Montoya Sanchez's two brothers are also in custody on drug charges. Juan Carlos has been extradited to the United States and Eugenio is awaiting extradition.

The U.S. State Department was offering a $5 million reward for Montoya Sanchez's capture. It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would get it.",1
572,Commerce secretary urged to quit over #sharpiegate 'threats',"image copyrightGetty Images

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been urged to resign after reportedly threatening weather officials who contradicted President Donald Trump.

Mr Ross' agency denied he intervened in #sharpiegate, the political storm over Mr Trump's erroneous claim that Hurricane Dorian might hit Alabama.

Alabama was initially forecast to be hit by Dorian, but was not on its path by the time Mr Trump said so.

The hurricane has battered the Bahamas, killing at least 50 people.

Scale of Bahamas hurricane devastation emerges

What is the row all about?

In an Oval Office briefing last Wednesday, Mr Trump updated the American public about the approaching storm, showing a six-day-old forecast map by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 29 August.

The map looked almost identical to the official NOAA map from that day, but the chart Mr Trump displayed had a black loop marked around Alabama that was not on the original version.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley later confirmed the map had been altered with a black felt-tip pen, known as a sharpie in the US, but did not say who made the edit.

In the previous days, Mr Trump had repeatedly asserted that Alabama would be hit by the storm.

However, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Birmingham, Alabama, tweeted that the southern US state would ""not see any impacts from Dorian"".

Journalists said Mr Trump was incorrect, irritating the president.

Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx

— NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019

How did Wilbur Ross reportedly get involved?

The NWS and NOAA both fall under the US Department of Commerce, which Mr Ross oversees.

On Monday the New York Times reported that Mr Ross phoned from meetings in Greece last Friday threatening to sack top NOAA employees unless they publicly backed Mr Trump's position.

The newspaper says the threat is what prompted an unsigned statement by NOAA later that day, saying that Hurricane Dorian ""could impact Alabama"" and criticising the Birmingham NWS tweet as ""inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time"".

A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce said the New York Times story was false.

""Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian,"" the spokesman said.

The Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General is examining NOAA's statement on Friday, according to the New York Times.

Who is calling for Wilbur Ross to resign?

Democratic lawmaker Don Beyer called for Mr Ross to step down over ""his direct attacks on the scientists and federal employees, whom he threatened to fire for doing their jobs by accurately reporting the weather"".

The Virginia congressman called the episode ""an embarrassing new low for a member of this [presidential] cabinet which has been historically venal and incompetent"".

Sierra Club, an environmental group, echoed calls for Mr Ross to go.

The organisation called the commerce secretary's alleged intercession a ""shameful abuse of power"", saying he had ""threatened to instil panic simply to give cover for Trump"".

New York Democratic congressman Paul Tonko said Mr Ross had ""put the safety of countless Americans at risk by compromising America's hurricane warning system just to protect the president's ego"".

Another Democratic lawmaker, Jim Himes of Connecticut, told CNN if the report is true ""that would be the most blatant use of an official position in the service of the ego and the political fortunes of the president that we have ever seen"".

Republican Senator John Thune, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, did not join calls for Mr Ross to quit but said it would be inappropriate for the commerce secretary to threaten the public servants.",1
476,Ex-Tyco chief Mark Swartz free on parole,"NEW YORK — Former Tyco International Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz was granted parole eight years after he was sent to prison for a $400 million fraud on shareholders.

Swartz, 53, appeared before the state’s Parole Board via teleconference Wednesday from the Lincoln Correctional Facility on West 110th Street and was granted approval, Linda Foglia, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, said in an email. He is tentatively expected to be released on Jan. 17, Foglia said.

Swartz, who served as Tyco’s CFO from February 1995 to September 2002, and former CEO Dennis Kozlowski were convicted by a jury in Manhattan in 2005 of defrauding shareholders of more than $400 million.

They are both serving sentences of 8 1/3 years to 25 years for stealing from the company and deceiving shareholders.

“We are grateful for the decision granting parole to Mark,” James Mitchell, an attorney representing Swartz with Ballard Spahr Stillman & Friedman said in an email. “This has been a long journey and he looks forward to a happy and productive future.”

Kozlowski, 66, is scheduled to appear before the Parole Board during the week of Dec. 3, Foglia said. Kozlowski sued the board last year after it denied a request for early release due to “concern for the public safety and welfare.”

New York State Supreme Court Justice Carol Huff in February annulled the Parole Board’s decision in the Kozlowski case and granted him a new hearing. An appeals court reversed Huff’s ruling in July, saying the denial of parole was “rational” based on the serious nature of his crimes.",1
727,Goldman Sachs to pay $3bn over 1MDB corruption scandal,"Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay nearly $3bn (£2.3bn) to end a probe of its role in the 1MDB corruption scandal.

The bank's Malaysian subsidiary also admitted in US court that it had paid more than $1bn in bribes to win work raising money for the Malaysian state-owned wealth fund.

US officials said the record settlement reflected Goldman's ""central"" role in a ""massive corruption scheme"".

Goldman admitted it had fallen ""short"", calling it an ""institutional failure"".

In all, the investment bank is due to pay about $5bn in penalties - about two thirds of its 2019 profits - to regulators around the world, including in the UK, to resolve cases that have severely tarnished the firm's reputation.

Goldman's board also said it will recoup or withhold $174m in compensation awarded to executives, including retired boss Lloyd Blankfein, under whose watch the scandal happened.

""The board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,"" it said in a statement.

What was the 1MDB scandal?

The 1MDB scheme was a global web of fraud and corruption, in which billions of dollars ostensibly raised for public development projects in Malaysia instead landed in private pockets, including those of the country's former prime minister Najib Razak.

Authorities in Asia, the US and Europe have spent years tracking down cash and assets paid for with money stolen from the Malaysian fund, including property, jewellery and art.

In announcing the settlement on Thursday, US Department of Justice officials said Goldman Sachs had enabled a scheme that caused ""significant harm"".

""That harm was borne principally and in the first instance by the people of Malaysia, who saw a fund created to benefit them... instead turned into a piggybank for corrupt public officials and their cronies,"" said Brian Rabbitt, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's criminal division.

In July, Najib was found guilty in Malaysia on all seven counts in the first of several multi-million dollar corruption trials and sentenced to 12 years in jail.

He had pleaded not guilty to the charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power and is appealing the decision.

What was Goldman's role?

Probes of Goldman Sachs focused on its help raising $6.5bn in 2012 and 2013 for the fund formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), work authorities said earned the firm more than $600m.

Goldman had long blamed rogue employees, asserting it had no idea the money it helped raise would be diverted from planned development projects within Malaysia.

But on Thursday, the bank admitted that its Malaysian unit had ""knowingly and willingly"" paid bribes to foreign officials and that it had ignored red flags that should have alerted higher-ups to problems with the deal.

image copyrightGetty Images

It agreed to return the $600m to Malaysia and pay roughly $2.3bn to regulators in the US, UK, Hong Kong and Singapore.

The settlement with the US charged the parent company with bribery violations, but authorities agreed to defer prosecution. That move allows Goldman to avoid a criminal conviction, a black mark that would have forced some clients to end work with the fund.

Earlier, one former Goldman Sachs partner, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to launder money and violating foreign bribery laws. Another executive is awaiting trial on foreign bribery offenses.

""We have to acknowledge where our firm fell short,"" chief executive David Solomon said. ""While many good people worked on these transactions and tried to do the right thing, we recognise that we did not adequately address red flags and scrutinise the representations of certain members of the deal team... as effectively as we should have.""

What other settlements have been announced?

Three months ago, Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlement with the Malaysian government for its role in the corruption scandal.

The settlement included a $2.5bn cash payout by Goldman, while the investment bank said it would guarantee that the government would receive at least $1.4bn from money recovered from the scheme.

The deal resolved charges in Malaysia that Goldman had misled investors.

Hong Kong regulators on Thursday said they were due to receive $350m in fines. Goldman has also agreed to pay $126m in penalties in the UK and $122m in penalties in Singapore.",1
804,Canadian PM defends 'stolen' money,"Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has admitted that ""a few million [Canadian] dollars"" may have been stolen during efforts to raise the profile of the federal government in the province of Quebec.

Perhaps there was a few million [Canadian] dollars that might have been stolen in the process
Jean Chretien, Canadian PM

Speaking to Liberal Party supporters at a fundraising dinner, the prime minister said the money was lost in a good cause - to preserve Canada as a united country.

Mr Chretien's government has become embroiled in a growing corruption scandal over contracts handed out to Liberal supporters.

The allegations are the subject of a police investigation and have already cost two ministers their jobs.

No apology

Many of the allegations centre on a programme set up to boost the federal government's profile in the prime minister's home province of Quebec, where French-speaking separatists came close to seceding from Canada in a referendum in 1995.

I had to make sure the presence of Canada was to be felt in Quebec
Jean Chretien

""Perhaps there was a few million [Canadian] dollars that might have been stolen in the process. It is possible,"" Mr Chretien told his supporters on Thursday night.

""But how many millions have we saved to the country because we have re-established the stability of Canada as united country?""

Mr Chretien said that if anyone had stolen the money, they would have to face the courts.

""But I will not apologise to any Canadians. With the circumstances in November 1995, I had to make sure the presence of Canada was to be felt in Quebec,"" he said.

Leaks

Mr Chretien obtained a landslide victory in 1993, after pledging to end corruption. He was elected to a third term in office in 2000.

But Canadian analysts say the growing scandal may force him out of office before the end of the five-year term.

Canadian reports say much of the scandal has been fuelled by leaks coming from within the Liberal leadership.

The National Post newspaper said the prime minister read the riot act to his ministers, warning he will demote anyone caught leaking.

Chretien loyalists within the party have blamed the leaks on supporters of Finance Minister Paul Martin, who is tipped to succeed Mr Chretien as party leader.

198,Zimbabwe accuses mobile phone operator Econet of money laundering,"HARARE, July 18 (Reuters) - Zimbabwean police have issued a warrant against the largest mobile phone operator Econet Wireless to hand over a list of its mobile money transactions and subscribers because authorities suspect it of involvement in money laundering, according to the warrant.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government has already suspended some of Econet’s mobile money transactions. Authorities last month also halted all trade on the local stock exchange.

In the search warrant issued on Friday night and seen by Reuters, police accused Econet of creating fictitious mobile money and converting it to cash to facilitate purchasing foreign currency on the black market and taking the money out of Zimbabwe.

The central bank has made similar accusations before, which Econet has denied.

A senior Econet official, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the government Econet would challenge the move in court.

A spokesman for the company said he could not immediately comment.

The police ordered Econet to provide a list of all subscribers, mobile money transactions and financial statements covering Jan. 2 to June 30 this year “for the purporse of investigating or detecting a case of money laundering.”

Police spokesman Andrew Phiri declined to comment.

Zimbabwe has alarmed investors with its decision to suspend the stock exchange.

Mnangagwa’s ruling ZANU-PF party has asked the government to de-list Old Mutual’s local unit from the Zimbabwe stock exchange, accusing it of fanning the foreign currency black market.

463,"Chinese remitters Tian Yinyin, Li Jiadong charged with laundering US$100m cryptocurrency","Two Chinese nationals were charged Monday with laundering over US$100 million in cryptocurrency that had been stolen by North Korean hackers, US prosecutors said.

Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were charged in an indictment unsealed in Washington with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Prosecutors allege the North Korean hackers gained access to a virtual currency exchange in 2018 and stole nearly US$250 million worth of virtual currency before laundering the cryptocurrency through several transactions. The hackers used doctored photographs and fake identification to avoid scrutiny and used the stolen money to pay for tools used in other North Korean hacking campaigns, the Justice Department said.

Authorities charge that between December 2017 and April 2019, Yinyin and Jiadong were responsible for laundering over US$100 million in cryptocurrency. They also allege the two did business in the U.S. and failed to register with the Treasury Department, as required by law.

The U.S. also alleges that North Korean co-conspirators are “tied to the theft of approximately US$48.5 million worth of virtual currency from a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange in November 2019.” Prosecutors said those hackers laundered the stolen money through hundreds of automated transactions.

“The hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money laundering for the benefit of North Korean actors poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system,” said Timothy Shea, the U.S. attorney in the nation’s capital.

In addition to the indictment, prosecutors also filed a civil forfeiture complaint to recover the stolen funds, which names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that they say were used by Yinyin and Jiadong and their alleged co-conspirators. Authorities say a portion of the stolen money has already been recovered.",1
687,Two Chinese Nationals Charged with Laundering Over $100 Million in Cryptocurrency From Exchange Hack,"Two Chinese nationals were charged with laundering over $100 million worth of cryptocurrency from a hack of a cryptocurrency exchange. The funds were stolen by North Korean actors in 2018, as detailed in the civil forfeiture complaint also unsealed today.

In the two-count indictment unsealed today in the District of Columbia, 田寅寅 aka Tian Yinyin, and 李家东aka Li Jiadong, were charged with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

“These defendants allegedly laundered over a hundred million dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency to obscure transactions for the benefit of actors based in North Korea,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today's actions underscore that the Department will pierce the veil of anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are located.”

“Today, we are publicly exposing a criminal network’s valuable support to North Korea’s cyber heist program and seizing the fruits of its crimes,” said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “This case exemplifies the commitment of the United States government to work with foreign partners and the worldwide financial services industry to disrupt this blended threat.”

“The hacking of virtual currency exchanges and related money laundering for the benefit of North Korean actors poses a grave threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Shea of the District of Columbia. “These charges should serve as a reminder that law enforcement, through its partnerships and collaboration, will uncover illegal activity here and abroad, and charge those responsible for unlawful acts and seize illicit funds even when in the form of virtual currency.”

“North Korea continues to attack the growing worldwide ecosystem of virtual currency as a means to bypass the sanctions imposed on it by the United States and the United Nations Security Council. IRS-CI is committed to combatting the means and methods used by foreign and domestic adversaries to finance operations and activities that pose a threat to U.S. national security,” said Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Don Fort. “We will continue to push our agency to the forefront of complex cyber investigations and work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to ensure these nefarious criminals are stopped and that the integrity of the United States financial system is preserved.”

“The FBI will continue to actively work with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to identify and mitigate illicit movement of currency,” said Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “Today’s indictment and sanctions send a strong message that the United States will not relent in holding accountable bad actors attempting to evade sanctions and undermine our financial system.”

“This case shows how important robust partnerships across the U.S. Government are in disrupting criminal actors,” said Acting Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division.

“This indictment shows what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to uncover complex cross-border crimes,” said Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). “HSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would steal cryptocurrency for their illicit purposes.”

According to the pleadings, in 2018, North Korean co-conspirators hacked into a virtual currency exchange and stole nearly $250 million worth of virtual currency. The funds were then laundered through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions aimed at preventing law enforcement from tracing the funds. The North Korean co-conspirators circumvented multiple virtual currency exchanges’ know-your-customer controls by submitting doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation. A portion of the laundered funds was used to pay for infrastructure used in North Korean hacking campaigns against the financial industry.

The pleadings further allege that between December 2017 and April 2019, Yinyin and Jiadong laundered over $100 million worth of virtual currency, which primarily came from virtual currency exchange hacks. The defendants operated through independent as well as linked accounts and provided virtual currency transmission services for a fee for customers. The defendants conducted business in the United States but at no time registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The pleadings further allege that the North Korean co-conspirators are tied to the theft of approximately $48.5 million worth of virtual currency from a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange in November 2019. As with the prior campaign, the North Korean co-conspirators are alleged to have laundered the stolen funds through hundreds of automated transactions and submitted doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation. The pleadings identify how the North Korean co-conspirators used infrastructure in North Korea as part of this campaign.

The civil forfeiture complaint specifically names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that were used by the defendants and unnamed co-conspirators to launder funds. The forfeiture complaint seeks to recover the funds, a portion of which has already been seized.

The charges in the pleadings are merely allegations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also imposed sanctions on Yinyin, Liadong, and numerous cryptocurrency addresses related to their involvement in activities facilitating North Korean sanctions evasion based on their services and support for malicious cyber enabled activities linked to North Korean actors.

The investigation was led by the IRS-CI, the FBI, and HSI. The Korean National Police of the Republic of Korea provided assistance and coordinated with their parallel investigation.

The cases are being handled by Trial Attorney C. Alden Pelker of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney David Recker of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Zia Faruqui and Christopher B. Brown, Paralegal Specialists Brian Rickers, and Legal Assistant Jessica McCormick of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. Additional assistance has been provided by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Youli Lee.

477,Emon Sassassalito‘s Fraud 24 exposed,"PATRIOTIC FRONT CONIVING WITH EXTRA 24 TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC FRAUD

The Patriotic Front engaged a renowned crock Emon Sassassali to raise Money for their campaign for the 2016 elections. He set up a company called Sun 99 in which he advertised Hardware and Building Materials. The Company Collected Money from Members of the Public without supplying any materials to the customers and after the 2016 elections the company disappeared.

Sassassali has been contracted again to raise funds for the 2021 elections for the youths. This time a company called Extra 24 was set up. The Company is fully registered with Pacra and operates in Villa Elizabetha on Plot No. 141, Washama Road. Extra 24 have been running advert on both Zambia Daily Mail, Times of Zambia for free and on facebook https://www.facebook.com/extralimted/ for over a year purporting to be supplying hardware and building materials. They collect money from people purporting to supply building and hardware material. The Police have full knowledge of these criminal activities but can’t do anything for fear of losing their jobs. Sssassali reports to the party Secretary General and the money raised is for use by the PF youths hence forming the Zambia Youth Initiative which works with Extra 24. He even brags that he has the full support of the Head of State where he reports.

From the proceeds of crime Mr. Sasssassali has bought himself an expensive Range Rover registration number BBC 8575. His protégé who leads the PF youth wing by the name of “Godfrey Chulu” was bought a Toyota Allion. The rest of the funds are channeled to PF cadres who have disguised themselves as Zambian Youth Initiative Project and claim to be able to do anything from roofing to bricklaying for the people who buy materials from Extra 24.

Young girls are employed to man the shop and collect money from unsuspecting Members of the public and these desperate girls are changed every week to confuse customers. Mr. Emon Sassassali and other PF cadres waits from an unknown location where they receive call from unsuspecting customers who can’t locate the shop or want to make business by phone. He even escorts some who get lost to the shop to pay for non-existing good. Mr. Sassassali gives different names to different customers such as Amon Banda, Amon Ngala, Amon Sassassali and Patrick Nkhowani. The Chief cadre who claims that he is the one who supervise the construction goes by the name of ‘Godfrey Chulu’ and he uses phone number 0977519026. Godfrey claims to be a civil engineer and a graduate of the University of Zambia. He leads the PF youths who are affiliated to the company and does the construction part of which is just a smokescreen.

In the initial stage the PF and Extra 24 limited got an agent from CAMCO to sale hardware materials and had promised the Chinese Businessman of Government Contracts. They got material and sold to people but never paid CAMCO for the material. CAMCO terminated the contract and to date Extra 24 Limited has not paid CAMCO for Material supplied to them. A check on CAMCO Managing Director a Mr. Tie Lie on 0977886128 he says they terminated the dealership after Extra 24 Limited started engaging themselves in criminal activities. Meanwhile the PF using Extra 24 Limited has continued collecting Money from the unsuspecting customs who have been responding to the adverts which have been flushed out on Government Media and were also distributed to people on the streets.

People from all over Zambia got in big numbers to pay for the materials which are deliberately priced lowly so as to attract customers but are never delivered. They are promised free transport for delivery of whatever materials bought worth more than K25, 000. Of the greatest thing lowly priced are Iron sheets but hiked when one wants to buy. Once one pays for Iron Sheets, they would tell him/her that they have to manufacture them from their factory which is located at Plot No. 687 A, Mumbwa Road, near Garden house Motel, Lusaka West which does not even exist. Imagine one paying for roofing sheet to cover the whole roof of the house and to lose the whole payment. When customers try to report the matter to Emmasdale Police Station or Lusaka Central Police which are nearest to where Extra 24 operates from, the police encourages customers to get some of the materials purchased and will tell them to wait for the big items to be delivered per company rules. Customers would collect items like nails and other small items. When further follow ups are made, the Police turns on the unsuspecting customers and tell them that they can’t arrest the culprit for failure to supply goods as it now becomes a civil case and not a criminal case. The Police in turn deliberately advise the customers to seek legal redress by suing Extra 24 Limited in court. The collaborating Police officers even get an allowance from Extra 24 Limited and have been queuing on Friday evening fueling their cars at Impala Service Station.

It is even laughable that Mr. Emon Ssassassali in a report which was carried by Mwebantu Media and other social media outlets has gone to claim that he has problems because of COVID 19 which have affected where he sourced material. He even has gone to claim that some of his customers owe him more than K900 000 without elaborating how exactly they owe him such amount of money. This is after Competition and Consumer Protection (CCP) have requested that he reports to their offices not later than 15th July 2020, which he did not. The PF are just using the inept CCP just like the Police which can’t do anything. Meanwhile Extra 24 and PF continues their criminal activities unabated.",1
462,Argentina: Top Macri officials indicted,"Federal indictments were issued today in Argentina against former Energy Minister Juan José Aranguren and the current head of the Anti-Corruption Office (OA), Laura Alonso, over charges of self-dealing by Aranguren and obstruction of justice on his behalf by Alonso.

The charges against Aranguren stem from his February 2016 order to import 195 million ft³ of natural gas daily from British Gas, a Chilean-based natural gas importer purchased by Shell Argentina just months before then newly-elected President Mauricio Macri named Aranguren Energy Minister.

The purchase was made after cancelling one from Bolivia - which was 56% cheaper.

Aranguren, 65, was CEO of Shell Argentina from 2003 to 2015, and is still a sizable shareholder in the firm.

He resigned as Energy Minister in 2018 after the Paradise Papers scandal revealed him to be a principal in two Barbados-based offshore companies - including a Shell subsidiary which received large contracts from the Macri administration.

These apparent conflicts of interest were first denounced in 2016 - but the case remained stalled in the courts largely because the Anti-Corruption Office (OA) refused to file charges.

Vulture culture

The OA is headed by Laura Alonso, who has refused to file charges against Macri or his officials in at least 20 cases in which the OA itself recommended them.

Alonso, 46, is the first OA head to belong to the same party (Macri's hard-right PRO) as the administration it is charged with overseeing - and the first to lack a law degree, which the post requires.

She received funding in 2014 by vulture funder Paul Singer, amid Singer's demands for a 1,600% payout on defaulted bonds bought from resellers. Macri's 2016 settlement reportedly netted Singer an 1,180% return.

Alonso and Aranguren become the second and third top Macri officials to be indicted since October 18, when former Social Security Trust Fund (FGS) director Luis María Blaquier was indicted over a 2016 FGS stock purchase in the Clarín Group - in which he was a major shareholder, and on which the FGS lost $22 million.

The Clarín Group, Argentina's largest media conglomerate, are prominent backers of Macri, who on October 27 became the first Argentine president to lose re-election.

Macri, who leaves office on Tuesday, is facing up to 144 charges ranging from corruption, self-dealing, and abuse of power against opponents.

But they have become more proactive since Macri's October 27 re-election defeat - and since revelations that Macri had been routinely spying on most of the judiciary.",1

788,Pastor Chris Oyakhilome in a $35 Million Money Laundering Scam,"Any moment from now, flamboyant miracle fixing pastor of Christ Embassy Church located in Oregun, Ikeja area of Lagos state, Chris Oyakhilome will be a guest of Nigeria's anti-graft police, EFCC for using his church to launder funds which source could not be accounted for into foreign bank accounts. The illicit funds so far traced by security agents stand at over $35 million.

The latest scandal may once again bring the controversial miracle-worker pastor under public scrutiny after government suspended the broadcast of his suspicious healing programme tagged “atmosphere for miracles” on public television stations some years ago.

iReports-ng can authoritatively report that a document on the money laundering activities of the architect turned pastor was first passed to the Nigeria police force headquarters in Abuja, last year. After finding it difficult to unravel the fraud, the police forwarded the matter to the EFCC which has the expertise and powers to successfully prosecute the pastor.

According to a source at the force headquarters in Abuja, the case was sent to the EFCC and received there September 24th 2009. Another source in the EFCC also confirmed that attempts were made by some of the controversial pastor's agents in the commission to “kill” the petition due to the electronic system of monitoring cases already put in place in the agency, called “gocase” by the United Nations Office On Drug and Crime, UNODC.

A reliable source in the agency told iReports-ng a few hours ago that ” after the initial hiccup, substantial progress has now been made on the case even though quietly and the coast now clear to invite the pastor to make some statements on his involvement in cash transfer of such huge amount of United States currency”

Apart from this discovery of money laundering activity by the pastor, a couple of his church officials and members have also of recent featured in some major fraud issues. Not quite long a time, one of his pastors in Ogba area of Lagos was said to have stolen some millions of naira from the sheraton hotels ikeja where he worked as a manager before he was sacked when the fraud was discovered. He claimed in his statement to the police then that he donated the stolen money to Oyakhilome's Christ embassy church to buy power generating sets and other church needs.

Also of recent, a young member of the church in Benin city, Edo state was arrested and prosecuted by the EFCC for engaging in internet marriage scam through which he defrauded a white lady. In his statement before he was convicted, he was said to have also confessed that he donated the bulk of the scam money to Oyakhilome's church where he belongs as a strong member.

Before the discovery of the pastor's money laundering activity, Oyakhilome had been enmeshed in other major scandals such as immoral sexual engagements with church members, fighting other religious leaders, use of diabolic powers and faking miracles.

In 2008, south africa media were awash with stories of fake miracles stage managed by the pastor in a bid to woo worshipers to join his church.",1
455,Update: Waste Management Inc.'s Dean Buntrock - the Greedy Former CEO of WMI Enters a Consent Agreement,"Update: Waste Management Inc.'s Dean Buntrock - the Greedy Former CEO of WMI Enters a Consent Agreement

Dean Buntrock: A Fish Rots from the Head - and this one was really rotten!

Or to put it another way, if it walks like a crook, talks like a crook... I reported on this website, years ago, of the misdeeds of Dean Buntrock, and his cronies and their crooked and incompetent mismanagement of Waste Management, Inc. It's nice the be proven right so clearly! Dean Buntrock and his cronies have signed a consent decree, basically agreeing to pay the fines and penalties to settle the SEC case against, without admitting their guilt; which to those of us who worked for them, has been obvious for many years!

The SEC charged Buntrock, Rooney, Hau, Getz, and two other former top officers of Waste Management with perpetrating a massive financial fraud lasting more than five years. The Commission alleged that, beginning in 1992 and continuing into 1997, defendants engaged in a systematic scheme to falsify and misrepresent Waste Management's financial results with profits being overstated by $1.7 billion. The fraud resulted in a restatement in February 1998, which at the time was the largest restatement in history. In other words, this was the ENRON type cooking-the-books"", long before ENRON!

The trial has been years in the making and it has finally reached its conclusion. On August 29, 2005, Dean L. Buntrock, Phillip B. Rooney, James E. Koenig, Thomas C. Hau, Herbert A. Getz, and Bruce D. Tobecksen agreed to make payments of over $30 million in total, comprised of $16.4 million in disgorgement, $10.4 million prejudgment interest, and $4 million in civil penalties. The disgorgement includes approximately $6.3 million in earnings-based performance bonuses from all settling defendants, $5.9 million in Buntrock and Hau's retirement benefits based upon the earnings-based bonuses, $3.5 million in losses avoided by Buntrock and Rooney from selling stock during the fraud, and $700,000 in tax benefits realized by Buntrock from gifting stock that was inflated by the fraud. The breakdown of the monetary relief is as follows:

Buntrock - $19,447,670 total, comprised of $10,708,032 in disgorgement, $6,439,638 of prejudgment interest, and a $2,300,000 civil penalty;
Rooney - $8,692,738 total, comprised of $4,593,764 in disgorgement, $2,998,974 of prejudgment interest, and a $1,100,000 civil penalty;
Hau -$1,578,890 total, comprised of $641,866 in disgorgement, $507,024 of prejudgment interest, and a $430,000 civil penalty; and
Getz - $1,149,756 total, comprised of $472,500 in disgorgement, $477,256 of prejudgment interest, and a $200,000 civil penalty.

The Judgments also permanently bar Buntrock, Rooney, Hau, and Getz from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Better late than never...

Additionally, Getz agreed to settle a related Rule 102(e) administrative proceeding to be instituted by the Commission by consenting to the entry of an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney for five years.

The Commission's litigation is continuing as to James E. Koenig Waste Management's former chief financial officer and executive vice president. The other senior officer named in the complaint, Bruce D. Tobecksen, settled in September 2004. [Release No. LR-18913] (September 30, 2004).

For those of us who suffered under Buntrock and his cronies, this is at least some justice. They're still rich from their misdeeds, but it is now a matter of public record that they were charged with the crimes, and rather than let it go to its inevitable complete, settled to pay back $30 million. They can say what they want, but it is obvious to me that if you are innocent, you don't agree to pay $30 million in fines and costs!

Hopefully, the public will learn from this lesson: The overpaid heads of many companies are in power and riches not because of hard work and genius, but often because of corruption, greed, bullying and criminal activities.

There some thing wrong with a society that would tolerate paying a CEO tens of millions of dollars. That's too much compensation for a head of a company, too much incentive to lie, cheat and steal to continue receiving that money year after year. As Lord Acton said almost 200 years ago, ""Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely"".",1
971,Long-Time Houston Physician Ordered to Prison for Tax Evasion,"HOUSTON – A local doctor who practiced in Houston for more than 30 years has been sent to federal prison following his conviction on of one count of tax evasion, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick along with Special Agent in Charge D. Richard Goss of IRS – Criminal Investigation. Edward J. Crouse pleaded guilty Aug. 28, 2018.

Today, U.S. District Judge Rosenthal ordered Crouse to Prison for 18 months to be immediately followed by one year of supervised release. He paid restitution of $678,103 prior to today’s hearing.

Crouse acknowledged in the plea agreement that he had not timely filed a U.S. individual income tax return since 1997. The plea agreement states that Crouse earned more than $4.4 million in years 2009 through 2012.

Crouse admitted in his signed plea agreement that he consistently committed numerous affirmative acts of tax evasion over the years to conceal his true income from the IRS, including concealing the complete business records of his medical practice for calendar years 2006 through 2012 from his bookkeeping and tax return preparation firm.

789,Payback time for criminals in one of the UK’s biggest tax frauds,"Five tax fraudsters who were part of a crime group involved in one of the UK’s biggest tax frauds have been ordered to repay £20 million, or face more time behind bars and still owe the money.

Michael Richards, 57 and Jonathan Anwyl, 46, both of East Sussex, Dubai-based Robert Gold, 51, Rodney Whiston-Dew, 68, of Greenwich, London and Evdoros Chrysanthos Demetriou, 80, from Oxford, were all jailed for more than 43 years. An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) found the group had devised a fake eco-investment scheme as a tax break for wealthy investors.

At the Old Bailey on 14 October and Southwark Crown Court on 13 December 2019, they were ordered to pay a combined total of £20 million or serve a further 39 years in prison.

If further assets are identified in the future for any of the convicted men, they could also be confiscated.

Martin Lynagh, Assistant Director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said:

“This was a carefully-planned and complex attack on the tax system and now the men have to pay up or spend even more time in prison, and still owe the money.

“Our actions don’t stop once someone is convicted, we will look to reclaim the stolen money, cash that should be funding vital public services in the UK. If you know of anyone who is committing tax fraud you can report them to HMRC online, or call our Fraud Hotline on 0800 788 887.”

The five men were sentenced in November 2017, to a total of 43-and-a-half years in jail, after HMRC investigators found they lured wealthy individuals to invest in Carbon Emission Reduction Certificates, which help countries hit environmental emissions targets set by the United Nations. But in reality, the money was diverted to purchase properties in the UK and Dubai, none of which was declared to HMRC. The £107.9 million fraud was one of the UK’s biggest tax crimes

Gold may need to sell a property in Dubai to settle his £2.6 million bill, and Anwyl, of Ringmer, East Sussex, cashed in his pension fund to help pay off his £250,000 order. Anwyl has paid his order and Gold has until late January 2020 to pay up or face an extra jail term.

Richards and Whiston-Dew have properties in West Sussex and South-West London which they may need to sell to pay off their respective £9.9 million and £3 million orders.

Another member of the crime group, Malcolm Gold, 75, previously of Hertfordshire was sentenced to 20 months in prison in January 2017. He was subject to a confiscation order on 5 October 2017 for £4,711, which was the amount of assets he had available at the time. The order was paid on 27 October 2017.

838,Moviehouse Madoff! Former Heights Cinema owner pleads guilty to Ponzi scheme,"The former owner of the Brooklyn Heights Cinema pleaded guilty on Monday to scamming investors out of $530,000 — rolling the credits on a local drama fit for the multiplex he once owned.

Ponzi schemer Norman Adie confessed that he promised victims that he would build condos over his Henry Street theater, but instead pocketed the cash for personal expenses and other projects.

He faces an 80-year sentence when he returns to Manhattan federal court on April 13, but it will likely be reduced to 27 to 33 months, his attorney said.

“My intention … was to build a successful business — as I had in the past — with the expectation that myself and all the investors would profit in the end,” Adie, 54, told Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz. “I’m very sorry.”

Prosecutors say that Adie began duping people into financing in his phantom development plans in 2007. He even collected $280,000 from one investor and shuffled the cash between bank accounts used by the theater and two of his troubled screens in Pennsylvania.

Then, in pure Ponzi scheme fashion, Adie managed to return some of the money to his victims, though it was peanuts compared to what he promised.

The feds busted Adie last year, charging him with securities and wire fraud.

But the quirky twin cinema got a happy ending.

This summer, local musician and left-wing hero Kenn Lowy bought the tumbledown 150-seat movie house and is transforming it into a hub for music, art and comedy shows in addition to indie flicks.

“I don’t think he was out to steal money from people,” Lowy said. “But he did something foolish and now he’s paying for it.”",1
896,Mexican Army Arrests Two Top Cartel Money Launderers,"Mexican authorities arrested two men identified as top money laundering associates of Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion–one of the most violent criminal organizations in the country.

This week, the Mexican Army and Federal Police raided a home in Zapopan, Jalisco. The targets of the raid were Arnulfo Gonzalez Valencia and his brother Ulises Jovani Gonzalez Valencia; both men are alleged leaders of the money laundering criminal organization known as Los Cuinis, a close ally of CJNG. Federal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. describe Los Cuinis as the financial wing of CJNG and able to launder billions for both criminal organizations.

The U.S. Department of Treasury has added Los Cuinis and their operators to the Kingpin Designation list, meaning that U.S. citizens are unable to conduct any businesses with the identified members or their businesses. The Valencia brothers are related to Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia, the wife of CJNG supreme leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes. As Breitbart Texas reported, Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia was recently arrested in Jalisco.

In recent years, Los Cuinis and CJNG became one of the most powerful criminal organizations in Mexico. Los Cuinis largely focuses on setting up multiple business fronts while CJNG expands the criminal empire through brute force and corruption. As Breitbart Texas reported, CJNG employed former Central American terrorists from FARC to train their gunmen in the use of improvised IEDs and other tactics.

967,"Robert Gabriel Mugabe, 1924-2019: A tragedy in three acts","“I have died many times — that’s where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once.” Robert Mugabe, on his 88th birthday.

Almost as long as there has been an independent Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe has presided over it. Thirty-seven years in charge. It wasn’t all bad. But it was mostly bad, and the history books that he loved to read will judge him harshly.

He was, from the very beginning, an enigma: a jumble of contradictions that somehow fuelled rather than felled him. He was the Anglophile who hated Britain; the freedom fighter who denied basic rights to his people; the pan-African visionary turned archetypal African dictator; the teacher who refused to learn from his mistakes. He was charming, and he was cruel. He was loved, and then he was hated.

As long as he was in power, one thing never changed. L’ état, c’est Mugabe. Mugabe was Zimbabwe. Now he’s gone, dying far from home in a hospital in Singapore, and Zimbabwe is still searching for a new identity.

ACT I: THE REVOLUTIONARY

“The people’s votes and the people’s guns are always inseparable twins.” Robert Mugabe, in a 1976 speech.

Mugabe’s secret was that he was always the cleverest person in the room. His formidable intellect took him from a modest background into some of the best schools in the land — the best black schools, of course, because he was a second-class citizen in colonial Rhodesia — and then to the University of Fort Hare in South Africa, which was then a production line for extraordinary Africans. Nelson Mandela studied there, as did Oliver Tambo, Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda.

At Fort Hare, Mugabe classmates were Pan African Congress founder Robert Sobukwe and soon to be Zimbabwe African National Union and Zimbabwe African People’s Union leader Leopold Takawira, and their revolutionary zeal rubbed off on him. Afterwards, he taught for a few years — in northern Rhodesia, and then in Ghana, where he met Sally, his first wife— but the die had already been cast. Mugabe was a freedom fighter and a fluent exponent of the language of pan-Africanism.

His struggle began on his return to Zimbabwe in 1960, where he immersed himself in the underground opposition, eventually taking a senior leadership role in the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu). In 1964, he was arrested for “subversive speech”, and imprisoned for a decade without charge — a guest of Ian Smith’s brutal regime.

Smith was typically cruel, denying Mugabe permission to attend the burial of his three-year-old son in 1966. This detail is important: later, when their roles were reversed, Mugabe allowed Smith to serve as a member of the Zimbabwean parliament in a powerful gesture of forgiveness and reconciliation. Mugabe was not always a tyrant.

In prison, he studied. Through distance learning, he earned first an undergraduate and then a Master’s degree in law from the University of London, respectively his fourth and fifth university degrees. He had already done another three through correspondence after Fort Hare, and there would be another masters in his future. This would make him, by quite some distance, the best-educated president on the continent, and possibly in the world.

But he was cunning too, exhibiting a ruthless, Machiavellian streak from which none were safe. From prison, he manipulated party processes until he was elected Zanu secretary general in 1974, sidelining better-known and more accomplished rivals.

After his release later that year, he fled into exile, clutching a portable typewriter as he crossed the border into Mozambique. Even then, he knew that words were his most potent weapon. While the bush war raged around him, Mugabe waged his own personal war against potential rivals both within the party and broader resistance movement. The infighting was vicious, violent and at times deadly, but Mugabe was good at it. By the time Smith was forced to the negotiating table, Mugabe had the party under control and was perfectly positioned to succeed him.

ACT II: THE STATESMAN

“Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen.” Robert Mugabe, undated.

Ironically, the modern Zimbabwe was born in London, in stately Lancaster House. It was there that the United Kingdom brokered talks between Ian Smith’s Rhodesia and the resistance to white rule; there that the roadmap to a second independence was created. Elections followed soon after in February 1980, with Zanu — which by now had merged with the Patriotic Front, to create the Zanu-PF behemoth — winning by a landslide.

For Mugabe, these were halcyon days. For a man with such a thirst for knowledge, what greater privilege could there be than to use that knowledge to create a nation? He set to work forging perhaps the finest education system in Africa, and turned Zimbabwe into the fabled ‘breadbasket for southern Africa’. Things were looking up, and he was celebrated by his peers and feted by the international community. Mugabe was a bona fide African hero, and he relished the attention.

But all was not as rosy as it seemed in the new republic. Mugabe’s authoritarian streak did not disappear now that he was in power. Quite the opposite, in fact. Joshua Nkomo, another liberation legend, was the highest-profile victim of the prime minister’s growing megalomania. Intimidated and fearing for his life, Nkomo fled into exile in 1983.

Much worse was to come. In Shona, there is a word for the early rains that come before spring, the rains that wash away the useless chaff and give the crops space to grow. That word is ‘gukurahundi’. In a message lost on no one in Zimbabwe, it was also the code name of Mugabe’s military operation to pre-empt resistance from the Ndebele community. The Shona were the healthy seeds, to be nurtured, while the Ndebele needed to be washed away.

To do the washing, Mugabe deployed his North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade. Over the course of five years between 1983 and 1987, they purged “dissidents” in Matabeleland and surrounds. Sometimes these were former war veterans, sometimes members of Nkomo’s Zanu. Sometimes they were civilians, chosen for no obvious reason except that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and belonged to the wrong ethnic group. No one knows exactly how many people died, because no records were kept. The state did not bother to count its victims. Conservative estimates put the death toll at 8 000 people. Others say it was closer to 30 000.

Not that anyone outside of Zimbabwe seemed to care. While the Ndebele were dying, Robert Mugabe was revelling in his reputation as an international statesman. It was only later, when his regime started killing white farmers, that he began to be treated like a pariah by the international community.

ACT III: THE DICTATOR

“This Hitler has only one objective: justice for his people, sovereignty for his people, recognition of the independence of his people and their rights over their resources. If that is Hitler, then let me be Hitler tenfold.” Robert Mugabe, in a 2003 speech.

Mugabe’s transition from freedom fighter to despised despot was slow, and uneven. To each their own moment of revelation, when the scales fell from their eyes and they realised that Zimbabwe’s president had begun, in some ways, to resemble his Rhodesian predecessor.

Perhaps it was Gukurahundi. Perhaps it was earlier, when Mugabe murdered and betrayed his comrades in his calculated bid to get ahead. Perhaps it was when he sent Zimbabwean foot soldiers to fight and die in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while he and his generals grew fat off the sale of smuggled minerals. Perhaps it was when he authorised the seizure of white-owned farms, and encouraged his thugs to take the land by force. Perhaps it was when he printed money to buy loyalty, tanking the economy in the process. Perhaps it was when he stole the 2002 election, or when he beat and bullied the opposition out of an outright victory in the 2007 poll.

Perhaps it was all of these things. Or perhaps it was none of them. For even now, with everything we know about what Mugabe did, he could draw a crowd. He could stand up at the African Union, aged 92, and rail against imperialism and homosexuality, and receive a standing ovation. When he was on form, he was charming, and eloquent, a spellbinding speaker. He was a consummate, charismatic politician.

That irresistible combination of charm, intellect and brutality allowed Mugabe to hold on to power for far too long, ruling Zimbabwe as his personal fiefdom, abusing the state and its resources to keep himself in State House, no matter what the cost.

Of course, it wasn’t the money that motivated him – his second wife, Grace, was the big spender — but the power. But even he could not hold on forever. In his last years in office, the vultures began circling, his age became more apparent, and his authority dwindled into nothing. He wasn’t calling the shots, not in the state or the party, and his orders were no longer obeyed without question. Kept in position while rival factions sought to further their own agenda, he was reduced to a stumbling figurehead, while the protests against his rule grew ever louder.

In the end, he didn’t get what he wanted. In 2016, at the United Nations, Mugabe told his fellow leaders — all younger and less experienced than him — that he would rule “until God says come”. A year later, he was betrayed by one of his closest allies, and forced into a humiliating, albeit long overdue, retirement. It is perhaps no surprise that once his power evaporated, so too did Mugabe himself begin to wither away, spending more and more time receiving medical care in Singapore.

Yes, there will be mourning. Not, perhaps, for the man himself; but certainly for the devastating, perhaps irreversible damage he’s done to the country that he promised to cherish and serve so many years ago.

Robert Mugabe’s death is no tragedy; his life, ultimately, was.",1
529,Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez,"In this Spanish name, the first or paternal family name is Castillo and the second or maternal family name is Rodríguez.

Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez (born 11 October 1976), commonly referred to by his alias Ojo de Vidrio (English: Glass Eye), is a Mexican suspected drug lord and former high-ranking leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a criminal group based in Jalisco. He is the son-in-law of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias ""El Mencho""), the leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. He was reportedly responsible for managing money laundering schemes for the CJNG.

In June 2015, he was arrested in Jalisco along with his brother-in-law Rubén Oseguera González (alias ""El Menchito""), and imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, Mexico's maximum-security prison. He was released a month later for lack of evidences. Mexican federal authorities re-arrested him in April 2016 for his alleged involvement in the CJNG.

Early life and career[ edit ]

Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez was born on 11 October 1976, in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico. [1] He is nicknamed ""Ojo de Vidrio"" (Glass Eye). [2] He is married to Jessica Johanna Oseguera González, the daughter of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias ""El Mencho""), the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. [3] [4] According to Mexican government sources, Castillo Rodríguez worked under Oseguera Cervantes as one of the CJNG's financial operators in the state of Jalisco. [5] He also reportedly led a group of hitmen for the CJNG. [6] Castillo Rodríguez has at least one sibling, Fernando Castillo Rodríguez (alias ""El Toro Valencia""), who reportedly worked for the CJNG. [7]

On 27 October 2016, the United States Department of the Treasury 's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Castillo Rodríguez under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the ""Kingpin Act"") for his alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. [8] This sanction was a result of an investigation done by the OFAC and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles in an attempt to disrupt the inner circle of the CJNG and affect their finances in Mexico's domestic economy. He was accused of providing material assistance to Nemesio and Abigael González Valencia (alias ""El Cuini""), the two leaders of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. [a] [10]

This sanction was also extended to eight more individuals: Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, businessman Fabián Felipe Vera López, attorney María Teresa Quintana Navarro, and five of González Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, Édgar Edén, Marisa Ivette, and Noemí, and Elvis. [11] As a result, all of their U.S.-based assets were frozen. The act also prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with them. [10]

2015 arrest[ edit ]

On 23 June 2015, Castillo Rodríguez was arrested by the Mexican Army and the Federal Police in the Lomas de Altamira neighborhood in Zapopan, Jalisco, along with his brother-in-law Rubén Oseguera González (alias ""El Menchito""). The operation lasted about 20 minutes and no shots were fired. The officers entered the private neighborhood in several vehicles at around 2:15 am. CT and subdued the entrance guard. They then shot the security cameras with paintball guns to obscure them, destroyed several others, and asked the guard to cut the electricity power in the vicinity. As they were in the entrance booth of the neighborhood, the telephone ran but none of them answered. The guard was then asked to kneel down while the officers entered the neighborhood and apprehended Castillo Rodríguez, who was inside a vehicle with Oseguera González. Authorities confiscated several weapons, including 2 customized AR-15 assault rifles engraved with the insignias ""CJNG 02 JR"" and ""Menchito"". [12] [13]

Castillo Rodríguez had a pending order of appearance in court and there was an open investigation against him for kidnapping and organized crime involvement. [14] Once in custody, he was taken to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave his statement and was interrogated by law enforcement. [15] [16] He was later transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as ""Altiplano""), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico, along with Oseguera González. [17] [18] Castillo Rodríguez was charged with using ammunition of exclusive military use, having five weapons of exclusive military use, carrying a firearm without a license, and organized crime involvement. [b] [18]

Release[ edit ]

On 1 July 2015, a federal judge from the State of Mexico ordered Castillo Rodríguez's release after concluding that the evidences against him were insufficient and that his due process was violated at the moment of his arrest and after he was in custody. [20] [21] The judge stated that when he was arrested in June, the officers did not have an arrest warrant against him and entered the private property without legal authorization. He also stated that the detainee was in custody for 9 hours and without a lawyer before he was sent to the justice department. [22] When the judge considered that authorities had failed to prove that he was involved in organized crime, he was released from prison. [23] [24]

Shortly before midday on 6 April 2016, Mexican federal authorities headed to Providencia neighborhood in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in several vehicles. [25] [26] When they arrived at the property they were looking to raid, they cordoned the area and entered the building through the front entrance while a helicopter flew over the vicinity. Neighbors stated that other federal agents surrounded the property through the rear and climbed the back walls from other properties. [26] The helicopter then descended at the golf course of the Guadalajara Country Club, where three military vehicles later arrived. [27]

At the scene, officials arrested Castillo Rodríguez and two of his companions, Édgar Ernesto Moreno Barragán and José Antonio Rodríguez Contreras. [28] It was a joint arrest conducted by the Mexican Army, Navy, the Mexican National Security Commission [ es ] and the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR); [29] no single shot was fired in the operation and authorities did not consider that the arrest created a risk situation. [30] About 50 officers participated in the operation. [31] Investigators seized four assault rifles, one which was equipped with a grande launcher, and a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher, similar to the one the CJNG used to shoot down an Army helicopter in 2015. [32] In a bulletin, the government stated that Castillo Rodríguez was responsible for coordinating money laundering schemes and other illegal activities for the CJNG, and that the arrest marked an important step in disrupting the financial, operational, and public relations structure of the criminal group. [33]

After his capture, Mexican authorities patrolled several areas in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area to prevent an aggressive response from the CJNG. The municipal police travelled in groups of three to five vehicles, while the Mexican National Gendarmerie [ es ] and the military patrolled the streets with a helicopter as backup. [34] Castillo Rodríguez and his two companions were then transferred to the SEIDO installations in Mexico City. [35] The evidence seized at the scene was also transferred to Mexico City for the PGR to investigate. [36]

On 20 October 2016, Castillo Rodríguez's wife issued a writ of amparo to prevent her arrest and deposited $MXN24,000 in bond insurance. This request was submitted through an appeal court in Jalisco. She had previously issued another writ of amparo against the National Banking and Securities Commission after the PGR froze her bank accounts as part of an investigation. [37] She owned a sushi restaurant chain in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, a rental cabin business in Tapalpa, and a tequila company in Tepatitlán; [c] investigators believed that she was laundering money for the CJNG through these businesses. [40] [41] Two months later, on 30 December 2016, an appeal court denied her writs of amparo. [41]

580,Armenian philanthropist involved in another Russian corruption scandal,"A well-respected Russian-Armenian philanthropist is at the center of another corruption scandal. But you won’t hear about it in the Armenian media.

The philanthropist, Ruben Vardanyan, is well known in Armenia for his projects including the Aurora Prize (an international humanitarian award given out at a ceremony in Armenia) and the United World College, an elite high school in Dilijan.

Now, a newly published investigation by Russian activist and investigative journalist Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has implicated Vardanyan in a web of corruption in the Russian republic of Tatarstan. One of the deals uncovered in the investigation was a “straight up bribe” of nearly $40 million from Vardanyan to the family of Tatarstan’s president, Rustam Minnikhanov.

The investigation is centered around Minnikhanov’s family and their multiple means of using their power to steal money, but Vardanyan appears repeatedly as abetting the corruption. One offshore account where the Minnikhanov family stashed some of its ill-gotten wealth was entirely owned by Vardanyan.

FBK described Vardanyan’s well-curated reputation as a philanthropist as “just an image, apparently aimed at his foreign colleagues and partners. In fact, he not long ago paid a straight-up bribe of three billion rubles to the president of Tatarstan. A logical question might pop up here: what does he have to do with Tatarstan?”

The piece continues: “Vardanyan and Tatarstan have long and close relations. Since 2006, the shares of his [investment fund] Troika Dialog and of him himself in [Russian vehicle firm] KAMAZ, which is based in Naberezhniy Chelnie” in Tatarstan. “Together with Minnikhanov, Vardanyan sits on the political council of Tatarstan’s state venture capital fund. And in his own words, he is ‘a big fan of Tatarstan.’ It shows.”

All this has been barely noted in Armenia.

Armenian media usually eagerly cover corruption scandals. The same day that the FBK investigation was published, local gambling company Vivaro was fined more than 700,000 euros by Maltese authorities for financial irregularities, and that was heavily covered by local media.

But the Navalny report was almost completely unmentioned in the Armenian press, save for a report on the news website epress.am, said Gegham Vardanyan (no relation to the philanthropist), a media analyst at the Yerevan-based Media Initiatives Center. “The news is almost non-existent in Armenia,” Vardanyan told Eurasianet. “He’s an important, influential figure in Russia and Armenia and it’s important that Armenian audiences know about the investigations about him, at least some reporting about them.”

It’s not the first time that a blockbuster investigation into Vardanyan’s affairs went unremarked on in Armenia. In March 2019, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and partners uncovered a multi-billion-dollar money-laundering network that allegedly operated through Vardanyan’s bank. The scheme also included stealing Armenian workers identities in Russia and using their accounts to transfer money.

Then, too, the affair was ignored in Armenia. Following the OCCRP investigation, “the media started talking about the topic only after [Ruben] Vardanyan’s response,” Gegham Vardanyan said. “Television, in particular, didn’t mention the topic at all.” (Ruben Vardanyan has not responded to the FBK allegations in the Armenian press; he did tell Forbes Russia that they were “complete nonsense.”)

The reason for the silence isn’t unclear.

Vardanyan was (until August 2020) a member of the board of directors at a big Armenian bank, Ameria, and used to be board president. Ameria is a heavy advertiser in local media and while “that fact could have played a role” in the silence, Gegham Vardanyan said, “it’s just a hypothesis and even if it is partially true it’s not justifiable.”",1
669,SFO charges three men over Axiom fund collapse,"Two former solicitors and a former independent financial adviser have been charged with multiple offences in connection with the collapse of the Axiom Legal Financing Fund.

The Cayman Islands-based fund – which lent money to several law firms to pay for disbursements, mainly for personal injury cases – closed in October 2012 in the wake of allegations of fraud, and went into receivership in February 2013 owing investors around £120m.

The Serious Fraud Office announced on Friday that it has charged Timothy Schools, Richard Emmett and David Kennedy with carrying out a fraudulent scheme to divert money from the fund for their own benefit.

The SFO began its investigation in 2014, although it only went public in 2017.

Mr Schools, 59, is seen as the main figure behind the fund and was struck off in 2014.

He has been charged with three counts of fraudulent trading, one count of fraud and one count of transferring criminal property.

Mr Emmett, 47, was struck off in 2018. He has been charged with one count of fraudulent trading and one count of being concerned in an arrangement which facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by another.

David Kennedy, 67, a former independent financial adviser, has been charged with one count of fraudulent trading.

Their case will be listed at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 30 September.",1
239,"Dozens charged in Atlanta-based money laundering operation that funneled $30 million in proceeds from computer fraud schemes, romance scams, and retirement account fraud","ATLANTA – Federal agents have arrested twenty-four individuals for their involvement in a large-scale fraud and money laundering operation that targeted citizens, corporations, and financial institutions throughout the United States. Business email compromise schemes, romance fraud scams, and retirement account scams, among other frauds, duped numerous victims into losing more than $30 million.

“Fraud schemes, like the ones perpetrated and facilitated by these defendants, inflict considerable losses on citizens, companies, and the financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak. “Some of these schemes target the elderly and often deplete the victims’ entire life savings. These arrests affirm the Department of Justice’s commitment to prosecuting those who prey on our most vulnerable citizens.”

“The FBI would like to thank our numerous federal, state and local law enforcement partners who helped make these arrests possible,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “There is no way we can make the victims of these schemes, many who have lost their life savings, whole again. Hopefully the arrests and pending prosecutions will at least give them solace that someone is being held accountable for their losses.”

“An important mission of the Office of Inspector General is to investigate allegations of fraud relating to employee benefit plans. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate these types of allegations,” stated Rafiq Ahmad, Special Agent-in-Charge, Atlanta Region, U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General.

“This investigation and subsequent arrests is due to the level of cooperation and information sharing by all law enforcement partners involved,” said Steven R. Baisel, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service, Atlanta Field Office. “The Secret Service will continue to collaborate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our partners to safeguard the nation’s critical financial infrastructure and the people in our communities.”

“No one deserves to have their hard-earned money stolen from them, so identifying and arresting these defendants makes everyone in the community safer,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in Georgia and Alabama. “Foreign nationals arrested in this scheme will be placed into removal proceedings upon completion of their criminal sentence.”

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the indictment, and other information presented in court: The defendants served as money launderers for other individuals throughout the world who conducted cyber-enabled fraud, including business email compromise schemes, romance scams, and retirement account scams, targeted at companies and individuals across the United States.

A “business email compromise” (BEC) is a type of computer intrusion that occurs when an employee of a company is tricked into interacting with an email message that appears to be, but is not, legitimate. The fraudulent email instructs the victim to wire money to a bank account controlled by conspirators.

A “romance scam” is a type of online fraud that occurs when an individual user of an internet dating website is targeted for fraud by an imposter posing as a potential paramour. The scammer creates a fake online dating profile that depicts photographs of an attractive man or woman alongside descriptions of the fictitious person. The scammer then uses this fake person to express romantic interest in the victim in order to trick him or her into sending money to the scammer. The scammer frequently targets vulnerable individuals who possess significant financial assets, such as retired widows or widowers.

A “retirement account scam” is a type of online fraud that occurs when a third party administrator (TPA) for retirement investment accounts is tricked into authorizing a money distribution to an imposter posing as the true accountholder. The imposter often starts the scam by calling the TPA, identifying himself or herself as an actual accountholder, and requesting a withdrawal distribution form. Once the imposter receives the withdrawal distribution form, the imposter returns the completed form to the TPA. The form is completed with the accountholder’s real personal identifying information (PII)—often stolen via BEC schemes, data breaches, and other hacking offenses—and bank account information for an account controlled by the imposter or the imposter’s conspirators. After the TPA processes the fraudulent request, the request is forwarded to the investment firm responsible for managing the accountholder’s investments, and the funds—often the accountholder’s life savings—are then directed to the imposter’s designated bank account.

The defendants and co-conspirators facilitated BEC schemes, romance scams, and retirement account scams by receiving and distributing fraudulent funds throughout the United States and the world. Over the course of the conspiracy, the defendants and their co-conspirators laundered over $30 million in fraud proceeds. The defendants created multiple sham companies that did not have physical premises, earn legitimate income, or pay wages to employees. In turn, the defendants opened business bank accounts at multiple financial institutions to facilitate receipt of the fraudulent money. The defendants also opened personal bank accounts to receive fraudulent funds, often using false identities and victims’ identities. After funds were deposited into the defendants’ bank accounts, the money was quickly withdrawn from the accounts and circulated among the defendants.

The following individuals have been charged with money laundering conspiracy:

Afeez Olaide Adeniran and Blessing Ojo are also charged with wire fraud. The indictment alleges that Adeniran defrauded a homebuyer of $40,000 intended for a real estate transaction. The indictment alleges that due to a computer intrusion and false invoicing scam, Ojo caused a media company in California to send payments totaling $89,140 to a bank account controlled by one of the defendants. In total, the victim sent $646,840, as a result of the fraud.

924,Nabil Sayadi,"Nabil Sayadi was the director and founder of the European branch of Global Relief Foundation, centred in Belgium.

Sayadi was born in Lebanon. He is accused that he transferred 200,000 Euros to Al-Qaeda financier Mohammed Zouaydi, which caused him to be placed on FBI and United Nations watch-lists along with his wife and GRF secretary Patricia Vinck. As a result, Belgium froze their bank accounts. [1] Neither organization had listed any crimes with which they are associated.

He currently lives in Putte, outside Brussels with his wife and four children, Omer, Younes, Rouqayah and Yassine. [1]

He has been described by the FBI as a close friend and associate of Wadih El-Hage, personal secretary to Osama bin Laden.

Belgian judges exonerated Sayadi of any links with Al Qaeda after Sayadi's lawyer declared: "" If the US has something against them, they should give it to us. [2] Recently, they won a process against the Belgian state and by that reason they are declared innocent and now have a chance of being removed from the blacklist.

Sayadi and Vinck filed a complaint in front of the human rights council. The council did not argue on the interplay of ICCPR and the UNC. But they decided that Belgium cannot review the SC decisions, but at least the obligations of Belgium under ICCPR. The council decided that Belgium violated the ICCPR as it was too fast listing Sayadi and Vinck on the blacklist, with not enough evidence.

As a result, in 2009 the names were delisted.",1

465,‘Britain’s sickest love rat’ serial fraudster posed as a cop and a lawyer to con more vulnerable women out of thousands,"A SERIAL fraudster once branded Britain’s sickest love rat pretended to be a cop and a lawyer to con £7,000 from three more vulnerable women.

Stephen Davey’s victims included a single mum who thought he was helping her with a court case and her friend who he convinced he loved.

Davey, of Wandsworth, South London, also said he had bowel cancer and needed money for a scan.

He was arrested after not paying his hotel bill.

He has more than 40 convictions, conned three ex-wives and in 2016 was dubbed a sick rat for pretending he had cancer.

Davey, 49, admitted five frauds at Liverpool crown court this week and got four years in jail.

Det Con Laura Gilbert said: “He is a manipulative and despicable individual who knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.”

He was divorced by first wife Debbie Hastings in 1993 after swindling her out of thousands and going to jail.

Second wife Dawn Hargreaves kicked him out ­after five days when she found he used stolen cheques to pay for the wedding.

Davey then persuaded Liz Noble, 23, of Hartlepool, to become his third bride. In 2003 he was jailed for four years for stealing £8,000 from her.

614,Tax fraudsters to pay £20m over fake eco-investments,"Five fraudsters sentenced to more than 43 years in prison for their part in a fake eco-investment scheme have been ordered to repay £20m to HMRC.

The men targeted wealthy investors looking for a tax break in a £107.9m fraud which HM Revenue & Customs claimed was one of the biggest such frauds seen in the UK.

Michael Richards, 57, and Jonathan Anwyl, 46, both of East Sussex, Dubai-based Robert Gold, 51, Rodney Whiston-Dew, 68, from London, and Evdoros Chrysanthos Demetriou, 80, from Oxford, were sentenced to more than 43 years in November 2017.

At the Old Bailey and Southwark Crown Court in October and December this year the fraudsters were ordered to pay a combined amount of £20m or face a further 39 years in prison.

HMRC said if it discovers any further assets belonging to the men in the future, they too could be confiscated to reimburse the money gained from the fraud.

The taxman expects the men may have to cash in pensions and sell properties in both the UK and Dubai to settle the tax bills.

HMRC found the fraudsters lured wealthy individuals to invest in carbon emission reduction certificates, designed to help countries hit environmental emissions targets set by the United Nations.

But in reality the funds were used to purchase properties in the UK and Dubai, none of which were declared to the taxman.

Martin Lynagh, assistant director of the fraud investigation service at HMRC, said: ""This was a carefully-planned and complex attack on the tax system and now the men have to pay up or spend even more time in prison, and still owe the money.

""Our actions don’t stop once someone is convicted, we will look to reclaim the stolen money, cash that should be funding vital public services in the UK.""",1
818,Jordan Belfort,"Jordan Ross Belfort (/bɛlfɔːrt/; born July 9, 1962) is an American author, motivational speaker, former stockbroker, and convicted felon. In 1999, he pled guilty to fraud and related crimes in connection with stock-market manipulation and running a boiler room as part of a penny-stock scam. Belfort spent 22 months in prison as part of an agreement under which he gave testimony against numerous partners and subordinates in his fraud scheme. [4] He published the memoir The Wolf of Wall Street in 2007, which was adapted into a film with the same name and released in 2013.

Belfort was born in 1962 in the Bronx borough of New York City to a Jewish family. [5] [6] [7] He was raised in Bayside, Queens. [1] [8] [9] [10] [11] Between completing high school and starting college, Belfort and his close childhood friend Elliot Loewenstern earned $20,000 selling Italian ice from styrofoam coolers to people at a local beach. [12] Belfort went on to graduate from American University with a degree in biology. [10] [13] Belfort planned on using the money earned with Loewenstern to pay for dental school, [14] and he enrolled at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. He left after the dean of the school said to him on his first day: ""The golden age of dentistry is over. If you're here simply because you're looking to make a lot of money, you're in the wrong place."" [15] [16]

Stock trading career[ edit ]

Early ventures[ edit ]

Belfort became a door-to-door meat and seafood salesman in Long Island, New York. [13] He claims in interviews and his memoirs that the business was an initial success; he grew his meat-selling business to employ several workers and sold 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms) of beef and fish a week. [13] The business ultimately failed, as he filed for bankruptcy at 25. [13] According to his memoirs and interviews, a family friend helped him find a job as a trainee stockbroker at L.F. Rothschild. [17] Belfort says he was laid off after that firm experienced financial difficulties related to the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987. [15] [18] [19]

Stratton Oakmont[ edit ]

Belfort founded Stratton Oakmont as a franchise of Stratton Securities, then later bought out the original founder. [18] Stratton Oakmont functioned as a boiler room that marketed penny stocks and defrauded investors with the "" pump and dump"" type of stock sales. [20] During his years at Stratton, Belfort developed a lifestyle that consisted of lavish parties and intensive use of recreational drugs, especially methaqualone —sold to him under the brand name ""Quaalude""—that resulted in an addiction. [1] [21] Stratton Oakmont at one point employed over 1,000 stock brokers and was involved in stock issues totaling more than US$ 1 billion, including being behind the initial public offering for footwear company Steve Madden. The firm was targeted by law enforcement officials throughout nearly its entire history, and its notoriety inspired the film Boiler Room (2000), [22] as well as the 2013 biopic The Wolf of Wall Street.

Stratton Oakmont was under near-constant scrutiny from the National Association of Securities Dealers (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) from 1989 onward. Finally, in December 1996, the NASD expelled Stratton Oakmont, putting it out of business. [23] Belfort was then indicted for securities fraud and money laundering in 1999. [24] [25]

Belfort served 22 months of a four-year sentence at the Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, in exchange for a plea deal with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the pump-and-dump scams which he ran that led to investor losses of approximately $200 million. [1] [26] Belfort was ordered to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled from stock buyers. [27] Belfort shared a cell with Tommy Chong while serving his sentence, and Chong encouraged him to write about his experiences as a stockbroker. [28] The pair remained friends after their release from prison, [28] with Belfort crediting Chong for his new career direction as a motivational speaker and writer. [29] At a motivational talk that he delivered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on May 19, 2014, Belfort stated:

I got greedy. ... Greed is not good. Ambition is good, passion is good. Passion prospers. My goal is to give more than I get, that's a sustainable form of success. ... Ninety-five percent of the business was legitimate. ... It was all brokerage firm issues. It was all legitimate, nothing to do with liquidating stocks. [25]

Federal prosecutors and SEC officials involved in the case, however, have said, ""Stratton Oakmont was not a real Wall Street firm, either literally or figuratively"". [30] [31]

Belfort's restitution agreement required him to pay 50% of his income towards restitution to the 1,513 clients he defrauded until 2009, with a total of $110 million in restitution further mandated. About $10 million of the $110 million that had been recovered by Belfort's victims as of 2013 was the result of the sale of forfeited properties. [32]

In October 2013, federal prosecutors filed a complaint against Belfort. Several days later, the U.S. government withdrew its motion to find Belfort in default of his payments, after his lawyers argued that he had only been responsible for paying 50% of his salary to restitution up until 2009, and not since. The restitution he paid during his parole period (since departing from prison) amounted to $382,910 in 2007, $148,799 in 2008, and $170,000 in 2009. Following this period, Belfort began negotiating a restitution payment plan with the U.S. government. [33] The final deal that Belfort made with the government was to pay a minimum of $10,000 per month for life towards the restitution, after a judge ruled that Belfort was not required to pay 50% of his income past the end of his parole. He has claimed that he is additionally putting the profits from his U.S. public speaking engagements and media royalties towards the restitution, in addition to the $10,000 per month. [34]

Prosecutors also said that he had fled to Australia to avoid taxes and conceal his assets from his victims, [35] but later recanted their statement, which had been given to the Wall Street Journal, [36] by issuing Belfort an official apology and requesting that the Wall Street Journal print a retraction. [37] Belfort also claimed on his website and elsewhere that he intended to request that ""100% of the royalties"" from his books and The Wolf of Wall Street film be turned over to victims. But in June 2014, spokesmen for the U.S. attorney said that Belfort's claim was ""not factual"", [38] claiming that he had received money from the initial sale of the movie rights that was not entirely put towards his restitution repayment. [36] BusinessWeek reported that Belfort had paid only $21,000 toward his restitution obligations out of approximately $1.2 million paid to him in connection with the film before its release. [39] Belfort has stated that he offered to put 100% of his book deal money towards his restitution but that the government refused the offer. [39] [40]

Writing[ edit ]

Belfort wrote the two memoirs The Wolf of Wall Street and Catching the Wolf of Wall Street which have been published in approximately 40 countries and translated into 18 languages. [4] A movie based on his books opened in 2013 starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, Jonah Hill, and Margot Robbie; the film was written by Terence Winter and directed by Martin Scorsese. [41] [42] He wrote his first book in the days following his release from prison (after a false start during his sentence, when he wrote and destroyed 130 initial pages). He received a $500,000 advance from Random House, and before its release, a bidding war began for the book's film rights. [29] The former Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted Belfort has said that he believes that some of the details in Belfort's book may have been ""invented"". [31]

Motivational speaking[ edit ]

Belfort has given motivational speeches. [4] [33] This has included a tour of live seminars in Australia entitled ""The Truth Behind His Success"", in addition to other appearances. In a 60 Minutes interview regarding his new career, Belfort stated of his previous life that his ""greatest regret is losing people's money"". [ citation needed ] He also runs sales seminars entitled ""Jordan Belfort's Straight Line Sales Psychology"". [43] When he first began speaking, he focused largely on motivation and ethics, then moved his focus to sales skills and entrepreneurship. [29]

His speaking engagements are run through his business Global Motivation Inc. and, as of 2014, Belfort was spending three weeks out of each month on the road for speaking engagements. The main theme of his speeches includes the importance of business ethics and learning from the mistakes that he made during the 1990s—such as believing that he was justified in skirting the rules of financial regulators simply because it was a common thing to do. [34] His per-engagement speaking fees have been about $30,000–75,000 and his per sales seminar fee can be $80,000 or more. The main subject matter of his seminars is what he has called ""Straight Line System"", a system of sales advice. [29] [43] Some reviewers have reacted negatively to the content of the speeches, specifically Belfort's recounting of stories from the 1990s. [44]

Australian training scandal[ edit ]

An investigation led by 7News and The Sunday Mail uncovered links between Belfort and employment company Career Pathways Australia run by Paul Conquest, who also has majority-ownership of Face to Face Training. [45] These two brands were heavily promoted at Belfort workshops held at Brisbane 's Eatons Hill Hotel. Belfort reportedly gave two workshops on Sales for the staff of Face to Face Training. [46]

Face to Face Training received $3.9 million from state government during FY -2014 and $6.34 million during FY-2015 for its training and assessment services. The majority of this money was expected to be spent on service training and certification which did not happen. 9 News Australia called the training program a scam and the certification program a ""Tick Flick"" [47] in its 60 Minutes segment.

During his time running the Stratton Oakmont business, Belfort and his first wife Denise Lombardo were divorced. He later married Nadine Caridi, a British-born, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn -raised model whom he met at a party. He had two children with her. Belfort and Caridi ultimately separated following her claims of domestic violence, which were fueled by his problems with drug addiction and infidelity. They divorced in 2005. [48] [49]

Belfort was the final owner of the luxury yacht Nadine, which was originally built for Coco Chanel in 1961. The yacht was renamed after Caridi. In June 1996, the yacht sank off the east coast of Sardinia [50] and frogmen from Italian Navy special forces unit COMSUBIN rescued all who were aboard the vessel. Belfort said that he insisted on sailing out in high winds against the advice of his captain, resulting in the sinking of the vessel when waves smashed the foredeck hatch. [51] [52]

Belfort is also an avid tennis player. [29]

[42] [55] Time magazine reported that many of the escapades depicted in the film are consistent with Belfort's memoirs and what was written about him in Forbes articles, although some of the Forbes -related content was embellished. [41] Belfort was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, who won the Golden Globe for Best Actor and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor for his performance.

401,Miguel Treviño Morales,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

In this Spanish name, the first or paternal family name is Treviño and the second or maternal family name is Morales.

Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales (born 18 November 1970), commonly referred to by his alias Z-40, is a former Mexican drug lord and leader of the criminal organization known as Los Zetas. Considered a violent and dangerous criminal, he was one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords until his arrest in July 2013.

Born into a family with six brothers and six sisters, Treviño Morales began his criminal career as a teenager, working for Los Tejas—a local gang from his hometown of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. His fluent English and experience of moving contraband along the U.S.–Mexico border enabled him to be recruited in the late 1990s by the drug lord Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, who headed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. Around 2005, he was appointed as the regional boss of Los Zetas in Nuevo Laredo and was given the task to fight off the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take over the lucrative drug trafficking routes to the United States. After successfully securing these routes in Nuevo Laredo in 2006, Treviño Morales was moved to Veracruz and appointed as the Zetas leader in the state after the death of the drug lord Efraín Teodoro Torres. Two years later, his boss Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano sent him to Guatemala to wipe out his competitors; after completing the task successfully, he appointed Treviño Morales as the national commander of Los Zetas in 2008. In 2010, Los Zetas gained their independence from the Gulf Cartel, their former allies, and both organizations went to war with each other.

As the national commander of Los Zetas, Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials and citizens throughout Mexico. The Mexican authorities believe that he is responsible for a significant part of the violence in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as el guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused with gasoline or diesel fuel, and burned alive. Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal power struggle within the organization.

Mexican Marines arrested Treviño Morales on 15 July 2013 in the state of Nuevo León without a single bullet being fired. At the time of his capture, the Mexican government was offering up to a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) reward for information leading to his arrest. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Authorities on both sides of the border believe that he was succeeded by his younger brother Omar Treviño Morales, a man who was also on the most-wanted list.

Early life[ edit ]

Miguel Ángel Treviño Morales was born on 18 November 1970 in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico. [1] [A 1] His parents, Rodolfo Treviño and María Arcelia Morales, created a large family with six daughters and seven sons, including Miguel. [A 2] Like many families along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Treviño family travelled from Mexico to the United States and vice versa, where they bought properties and opened several businesses. [3] [4] His father abandoned his family at a very young age, forcing Treviño Morales to single-handedly raise the whole family. [5] Treviño Morales grew up in a lower-class neighborhood in Nuevo Laredo, but as a teenager, he worked for the wealthy by fixing their yards and washing their cars. He also did chores for the local drug lord Héctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa (alias El Karis), who later became his mentor; Treviño Morales eventually replaced him as a Zetas leader in Nuevo Laredo. [5] [6] Treviño Morales grew up disliking Mexico's class disparity and developed so much resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult. [6] Treviño Morales frequented Dallas, Texas with his family. [7] In 1993, he was apprehended in Dallas County and charged with avoiding police arrest, after he had tried to lose the cops in a police car chase that ended in a street dead end. He paid a $672-dollar fine and was subsequently released from the county prison. Few details are known of Treviño Morales's life in Dallas; [8] the U.S. authorities believe he learned about ""power, money, weapons and the vast consumer market for illegal drugs"" while living in Texas. [6] They also believe that he perceived an anti-Mexican bias among Americans, and especially towards Mexican immigrants like him. However, Treviño Morales considered Dallas his home because of his large family network that lives in the surrounding areas. [6] According to U.S. investigators, he was last seen in the Dallas area in 2005 after entering the United States illegally, where visited his family and was said to have been at a strip club. [5] [6]

Criminal origins and ascension[ edit ]

As a teenager, he began to work for Los Tejas, a gang that ran the criminal activities in his hometown of Nuevo Laredo. [9] From washing cars, running errands, and stealing car parts in Nuevo Laredo, Treviño Morales turned to the drug trade, starting with small-scale drug retail sales and smuggling. [10] [11] Unlike the first members of Los Zetas, he was never in the military. He was hired by them and the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s for his experience moving contraband across the border. [4] [12] [10] His fluent English and his criminal contacts on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border allowed him to gain the trust of the then-leader of the Gulf Cartel, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. [13] When he joined the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, Los Tejas, the local gang he once worked for, was absorbed by the former groups. Around 2005, Treviño Morales became the regional boss of Nuevo Laredo; he was in charge of fighting off the incursions of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was attempting to take control of the smuggling routes in the area. The Laredo–Nuevo Laredo area is a lucrative smuggling route for narcotics because of the Interstate 35 highway, which serves as a strategic pathway to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas for future drug distribution. While in power, he orchestrated a number of assassinations in American cities and in Mexico by young U.S. citizens whom he put on his payroll. [9] [10] [14] Treviño Morales was good at identifying and grooming young teenagers who he believed had the potential to become professional assassins for Los Zetas. These recruits, sometimes called Zetitas (""Little Zetas""), usually joined organized crime as young as twelve-years old to work first as smugglers and later as paid assassins. [15]

By 2006, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas managed to defeat the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo. The latter cartel concentrated its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started to expand into other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. [16] [17] He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. [18] Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; [19] when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf Cartel. [17]

In November 2007, the city of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in connection with a 2006 double homicide in Texas. [20] In 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. [21] [22] It had just gone to war with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. [13] Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. [23]

In February 2008, Lazcano Lazcano sent Treviño Morales to kill rival drug traffickers and take control of the drug trafficking routes in Guatemala. Reportedly, he carried out a military-like ambush that resulted in the death of the Guatemalan drug lord Juan José León Ardón (alias Juancho) in March. An unnamed U.S. official said that Treviño Morales may have been the man who fired the bullet that killed the drug kingpin. [24] Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background. In this position, Treviño Morales had a say in nearly all the decisions Los Zetas made at a national level, creating some resentment among the old-generation commanders of Los Zetas who, unlike him, had been in the Mexican Armed Forces before turning to the drug trade. [24]

Treviño Morales acted as a cartel 'gate-keeper,' and his people collected a piso (tariff) at all drug territories controlled by Los Zetas. [13] [25] [26] He controlled the highly lucrative Nuevo Laredo plaza (turf), across the border from Laredo, Texas. He bribed and intimidated officials to help maintain control, and responded to any challenges to his authority or control with brutal violence. [27] [28] Treviño was feared and very few local journalists dared to write about him. [29] He was alleged to have favored a torture method known as el guiso (stew), in which people are stuffed into an oil barrel, doused with gasoline or diesel fuel, and set on fire to burn alive. [30] [31] His violent behavior gained him ""the notoriety of a cult figure."" [4] He reportedly survived gun battles unharmed, avoided making alliances with anyone, dismembered dozens of victims while they were still alive and dumped them, and ""seemed unafraid to die."" [4] Organization members claimed that Treviño Morales enjoyed driving around the city in a car, pointing at people randomly and saying, ""kill this one and kill that one."" [32] A former hitman who worked for him told the press in 2013 that Treviño Morales could not sleep at night if he did not kill someone. He also said that the drug lord would ask his victims how they wanted to be killed. [33] Journalist Alfredo Corchado, head of The Dallas Morning News in Mexico, wrote in one of his books that Treviño Morales enjoyed eating out the hearts of his victims—even when they were still alive—because he believed that doing that would make him invincible among his enemies and authorities. [34]

Treviño Morales reportedly coordinated several violent attacks throughout Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people a year later in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. [35] He is also believed to have threatened to shoot down the plane of the former President Felipe Calderón in August 2012 while on a trip to the state of Tamaulipas. Although it was not the first time Calderón received death threats from organized crime, the authorities deemed the drug lord's threat as credible, and urged the President to cancel his trip (though he ultimately went anyway). [36] [37] Under Treviño Morales' leadership, Los Zetas were considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to be highly sophisticated, advanced, and one of the most dangerous criminal organizations operating in Mexico and the hemisphere. [32] [38] He was widely regarded as one of the most violent drug lords operating in Mexico. [33] [39] [40] [41]

Treviño Morales reportedly moved around through Mexico and Central America, and often met with Colombian drug lords in Mexico City, the nation's capital, to do business. To escape law enforcement notice, he used ""caravans"" of purported businessmen and religious persons. In the northern part of the country, he reportedly maintained a close tie with a number of politicians. His brother Omar Treviño Morales (Z-42) leads Los Zetas in the Gulf of Mexico. [42]

Split between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel[ edit ]

Cárdenas Guillén was arrested in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 2003 and extradited to the United States in 2007. While in prison in Mexico, he reportedly coordinated the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas from his prison cell. But with his extradition, Treviño Morales's organization experienced a leadership crisis. La Compañía (The Company), a name used to describe the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas as a conglomerate, remained in a loose cooperation until early 2010, when violence erupted between both groups. [43] [44] On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped Víctor Peña Mendoza (alias Concord 3), a leader of Los Zetas and close associate and friend of Treviño Morales. When he was held captive, Peña Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf Cartel, but he refused, earning a beating followed by execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego. [45]

Treviño Morales heard about the incident and issued an ultimatum to Flores Borrego and Gulf Cartel leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez:

Hand over the assassin of my friend, you son of a bitch ... You have until the 25th, if you don't comply, there will be war. [46]

Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders ignored the command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge the death of his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and slaughtered 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths. [46] [47] Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It managed to take control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. [48] With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories. [49] [50]

In 2011, however, Treviño Morales's criminal organization entered a new internal strife after Jesús Enrique Rejón Aguilar (alias El Mamito), one of their highest-ranking leaders, was arrested in July. Though he did not call out any names, he stated that someone within Los Zetas had betrayed him. Shortly thereafter, alleged organized crime members uploaded a narcocorrido music video on YouTube portraying Treviño Morales ""as the New Judas"" and accusing him of setting up the arrests and deaths of other commanders within the criminal organization and being disloyal to Lazcano Lazcano, his boss. [49] [51] In several articles published in August 2012, a U.S. law enforcement official told the press that Treviño Morales had successfully taken the leadership of the cartel and displaced Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, the long-time leader. [52] [53] Treviño Morales began to take over the assets of Los Zetas and was working to remove Lazcano Lazcano as the head since early 2010. [54] Amidst the Zetas civil war, many high-ranking members in Los Zetas began to fall. High-ranking Zetas leader Iván Velázquez Caballero (alias El Talibán) was arrested in September 2012, presumably set up either by rival gang members or gangsters aligned with a group related to Treviño Morales. [55] On 6 October 2012, drug lord Salvador Alfonso Martínez Escobedo (alias La Ardilla) was arrested in Nuevo Laredo by the Mexican Navy. [49] [56] After Velázquez's fall, a split off group known as Los Legionarios (The Legionaries) was born in Nuevo Laredo and vowed to bring down Treviño Morales for allegedly betraying him. A second faction from Los Zetas, known as Sangre Zeta (Zetas Blood), also broke up from the organization to join forces against him. [57]

The active role of Treviño Morales got him the loyalty and respect of many in Los Zetas, and eventually many stopped paying to Lazcano Lazcano. [30] In order to avoid his arrest or death from betrayal, Lazcano Lazcano reportedly fled the country and lived in Germany and Costa Rica for an unknown time with surrounding rumors that he had terminal cancer. [58] [59] [A 3] Back in Mexico, Treviño Morales had become the stronger of the two in Los Zetas. [59] Lazcano Lazcano was then killed by the Mexican Navy in the state of Coahuila on 7 October 2012, [61] and Treviño Morales succeeded him as the top leader of Los Zetas. [62]

Bounty and indictments[ edit ]

In 2009 in New York and in 2010 in Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment against Treviño Morales for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine into the United States from Mexico and Guatemala. [63] [64] [65] There was a bounty for him in Mexico set at $30 million MXN (US$2.3 million) and another one in the U.S. at US$5 million ($62.4 million MXN). [66] [67] Los Zetas are responsible for the smuggling of multiple tons of cocaine, marijuana, and heroin into the United States from Mexico annually. [68] [69] He was also considered one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. [70]

Treviño Morales is known by various aliases: L-40 (40, Z-40, Zeta 40), Comandante Cuarenta, El Cuarenta, David Estrada-Corado, and La Mona. [71] [72]

Kingpin Act sanction[ edit ]

On 20 July 2009, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Treviño Morales under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the ""Kingpin Act""), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with three other international criminals. [73] The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. [74]

Arrest[ edit ]

A month before his capture, U.S. authorities had been passing down information to their counterparts in Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo border area to see his newborn baby. They got this intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. [75] Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired. [76] [77] [78] The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. [79] He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. [78] Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later. [75] [80] [81]

Imprisonment[ edit ]

At the time of his arrest, Treviño Morales had pending charges for organized crime involvement, drug trafficking, torture, money laundering, and the illegal use of firearms under Mexican law, among other charges. [82] However, he only declared the money and firearms that were confiscated during his arrest. [83] Following his arrest, the drug lord was flown to Mexico City and kept at the SEIDO installations, Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency. [84] On 19 July 2013, he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico, via helicopter. [85]

On January 2014, a New York federal district court issued other criminal charges against the drug lord. The investigation alleged that Treviño Morales conspired to order killings against rival gangsters of Los Zetas, members of his own criminal organization, and Mexican policemen and personnel of the Mexican Army from September 2004 to July 2013. The court, which sought his extradition, also stated that the drug lord conspired to traffic drugs to the U.S. [86]

On March 27, 2017, Treviño Morales was transferred to a federal prison in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, through a precautionary inmate rotation program. [87] He was then imprisoned in Puente Grande, Jalisco, outside of the city of Guadalajara, until June 30, 2020, whereupon he was transferred to the Federal Center for Social Readaptation (Cefereso) 17, located in Buenavista Tomatlán, in Tierra Caliente, Michoacán. [88]

Miguel's brother José Treviño Morales was arrested on 12 June 2012 by a combined U.S. federal task force. He has been indicted as one of the money launderers for the Zetas through an Oklahoma-based American Quarter Horse racing operation. [4] [89] His nephew Alejandro Treviño Chávez was killed during a shootout in the state of Coahuila on 5 October 2012 by a law enforcement group; in response, Miguel ordered the murder of José Eduardo Moreira, nephew of governor of Coahuila Rubén Moreira, and son of Humberto Moreira (Governor of the State of Coahuila from 2005 to 2011). [90] [91] [92]

His younger brother is Omar Treviño Morales, who is said to have replaced Miguel's leadership role in Los Zetas. At around 4:00 a.m. on March 4, 2015, Treviño Morales was captured inside a residence in Fuentes del Valle, an upper-class neighborhood in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León, by the Federal Police and the Mexican Army. [93] Not a single shot was fired in the operation. [94] [95] In a nearby neighborhood, authorities arrested his financial operator Carlos Arturo Jiménez Encinas, along with four other people. [96] Four days later he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico. [97] He was formally charged in a federal court in Toluca, State of Mexico on March 13 for money laundering and for violating Mexico's Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives. [98]

Miguel's older brother, Juan Francisco Treviño Morales, is currently imprisoned in the United States; his son (and nephew of Miguel), Juan Francisco Treviño Chávez, alias El Quico, was arrested in Monterrey on 15 June 2012. [99] Eduardo Treviño Treviño, another nephew of Miguel, was arrested in Nuevo Laredo in May 2013 and awaits an extradition to the United States for kidnapping and drug trafficking charges that date back to 2010. [100] Miguel's wife Juanita del Carmen Ríos Hernández was included in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act on February 2014, banning U.S. citizens from doing any kind of business activities with companies under her name.

16,Two decades of corruption at the highest level in Central America,"If it’s true that the people get the government they deserve then, judging by the past 20 years, Central American voters need to examine their consciences.

Of 32 presidents serving the region’s six countries between 1990-2010, 13 are behind bars, in exile or under investigation for crimes ranging from human trafficking to money laundering. The list would be longer were it not for the fact that sitting presidents and legislators are immune from prosecution.

Nicaragua’s president Daniel Ortega (1979-1990 and 2007-present) escaped charges of sex abuse and corruption by cutting a deal with old enemies and changing the constitution to enable perpetual re-election and with it, perpetual immunity.

The most prolific member of this motley crew is former Guatemalan president Alfonso Portillo (2000-2004), extradited last year to the US where he is serving a 20-year sentence for laundering $70 million of public money through US banks. During the trial he was accused of turning his country’s treasury into a “private ATM machine”.

Killed two students

Mexico

On the eve of his election victory, speaking to The Irish Times, he pledged to end corruption. “Morality and ethics are the founding principle of this government and I will be a loyal servant”, he said.

Behind the scenes, he was the loyal servant of retired Guatemalan general Efraín Ríos Montt, ineligible for office due to his role as de facto president when thousands of indigenous men, women and children were massacred in the 1980s.

Earlier this year, Francisco Flores Pérez, former president of El Salvador (1999-2004), fled the country after the attorney general’s office charged him with stealing a $10 million donation from the Taiwanese government intended for victims of a 2001 earthquake.

The fugitive has had his financial assets frozen and an arrest warrant was issued in May. “This might look like a routine corruption investigation in other countries but here it is absolutely groundbreaking”, commented Gregorio Rosa Chávez, archbishop of San Salvador. “Everyone is waiting and watching to see if this is for real or just another show.”

Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, Nicaragua’s president from 1997 to 2002, lavished gifts on his friends and financed a lengthy honeymoon for his wife, drawing funds from a bottomless government credit card.

Alemán was formally charged in December 2002, and given a 20-year prison term for crimes including money- laundering and corruption.

Due to ill health he was allowed to serve his sentence at home and his strategic alliance with President Ortega resulted in a power-sharing arrangement that saw his guilty verdict overturned in 2009.

Alemán’s predecessor, Enrique Bolaños Geyer (2002- 2007), was also questioned over Taiwanese donations to his election campaign, along with human trafficking, but his position as a parliamentary deputy guaranteed him immunity.

In Honduras, former president Rafael Leonardo Callejas (1990-1994) was accused of abusing his office after investigators revealed he had apparently diverted a fund for oil payments into his private account. The case was delayed long enough to reach its statute of limitation.

Manuel Zelaya assumed office in Honduras in 2006 but his term was cut short by a military coup when he allied himself with the region’s left-wing governments. Zelaya was accused of corruption but the charges were shelved once the ousted president agreed not to run for office again.

In Costa Rica, former presidents Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier (1990-1994) and José María Figueres (1994-1998) were jailed for corruption. Their successor Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Echeverría (1998-2002) fled to Spain for seven years, fearing a similar fate.

Ernesto Pérez Balladares, Panamanian president from 1994 to 1999, was accused of receiving bribes in return for granting casino licences but was eventually absolved. Mireya Moscoso, his successor, was renowned for her expensive taste in clothes and jewellery. After leaving office she was charged with stealing $45 million donated from abroad and with an unexplained $146,000 gift of watches to favoured legislators. She was absolved of all charges.

Guatemala’s former president Jorge Serrano Elías (1991-1993) has been exiled in Panama since he attempted to dissolve congress and shut down the Supreme Court. He has successfully fought efforts to force his return to face charges of misuse of state funds.

Nobel prize

In their defence, Central America’s disgraced presidents argue they inherited weak political institutions with a legacy of brutality and corruption. The outcome, however, is a widespread disregard for the rule of law and an alarming growth in crime and violence as citizens seek to emulate their leaders’ example.",1
962,Caputo’s Appearance Before Congress Ends in Scandal (and With an Emoji),"Heated discussions; crossed accusations; a power outage and a piece of paper that prompted a scandalous, early end to a congressional session.

In a much anticipated appearance before the Special Committee of Oversight and Control of the Administration and Payment of Public Debt in Congress (yes, that’s the real name) Finance Minister Luis Caputo faced senators and deputies from the opposition who grilled him about Argentina’s public debt and, more importantly, his offshore associations.

For four hours, Caputo engaged in tense exchanges, mostly with FpV deputies, who strongly criticized him for failing to disclose in his tax returns that he was involved in a series of offshore accounts – a revelation that saw the light of day with the so-called Paradise Papers scandal last year. The minister was also questioned about what opposition leaders say is the increase of public debt issued by the Macri administration.

Caputo began his appearance by delivering a presentation in which he explained the government’s economic policies, assuring they are aimed at achieving a stable economic growth that extends for “many years” and “eradicating poverty.” In doing so, he defended the level of debt issued, saying it is necessary to finance the policies aimed at gradually reducing the fiscal deficit.

He did concede, however, that it will be impossible for the country to maintain this level of debt issuance for “20, 10 or five years.”

“It is reasonable that we have to explain whether this debt is sustainable and why this time it will be different [i.e. the country will not end up in a crisis of debt]. Debt is exactly that: a reflection of the deficit. What we have to do is reduce the deficit,” he said.

After Caputo finished his report, lawmakers present proceeded to ask him the questions they had prepared for him. Former Economy Minister and current Deputy Axel Kicillof was one of the most critical ones, grilling the minister for – according to him – not handing over “relevant reports” concerning the negotiations with holdout creditors and his offshore accounts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDCEjNO8OU8

“Offshore accounts are an instrument to commit crimes. They might serve other purposes. One can have poison and say it’s good for something else. When you have an instrument to commit a crime, you usually use it to commit a crime,” he said.

Further into the session, Senate president Federico Pinedo said that the reports mentioned by Kicillof had never been concealed, and that they were “available” for examination for all committee members.

In regards to his offshore accounts, Caputo said that “his only crime was not declaring them.”

“Think of an offshore account as a safety deposit box. It does not make them evil. People have to be responsible for what they have in them. In my case, I’ve already said it. I don’t have anything to do with that company (Noctua Partners, presumably). I have declared everything to the Anti-Corruption office and the AFIP [tax collecting agency], everywhere. In regards to that report from the SEC (a recent report that revealed that he actually owned Noctua), I did not own it. I can’t declare something that is not mine.”

Regarding the issuance of public debt, he said “we have to try to reduce the dependence of external financing,” some that the Macri administration has been trying to correct that since day one.”

Later at noon, while FpV Senator Sigrid Kunath was asking questions, the power went out.

During that time, the session continued and lawmakers present had to ask questions without a microphone. 10 minutes later, the power came back.

The session finished abruptly shortly after 1 PM, when FpV Deputy Gabriela Cerruti got up from her chair and suddenly started screaming at Caputo, waving a piece of paper while everyone around her looked confused.

Unable to ease the tension, President of the Committee José Mayans decided to finish the session.

Immediately after, FpV deputies, led by Cerruti, ran to the TV cameras in the room to display a piece of paper that read: “My daughters are 11 and 13 years old, please don’t be so mean :)”.

(Yes, it actually included a smiley face.)

Cerruti accused Caputo of gender-based violence: “He sent me a piece of paper through an aide. He gestured at me and asked me to read it. He can’t send me a piece of paper in the middle of a session, I am a deputy, I don’t know him. He lied to us since minute one.” And regarding its content, she said: “either this is a threat, or it trivializes the situation, or whatever you want to call it. It is sexist, misogynistic, all of that,” she said. Agustín Rossi, on his end, asked for Caputo to resign.

On Cambiemos’ side, Deputy Eduardo Amadeo said that Cerruti had previously made a reference to Caputo’s children. “Then he answered he has two daughters, it is what any father who feels like that would do.”

Caputo’s communication team released a statement after the scandal, apologizing for sending the message: “I reacted as a father and not as a public official. It was not the place nor the way to do it. In no time I intended to offend anyone. I spent four and a half hours answering every single question.”",1
393,Hilux hoax adds to former Zim minister Ignatius Chombo's charges,"Embattled former finance minister Ignatius Chombo faces new fraud charges linked to the embezzlement of Z$14-billion he received from the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe in December 2005.
Chombo already faces several corruption charges, brought after the fall of Robert Mugabe last year. Since then, he has been in and out of court for routine appearances. The latest charge is in line with President Emmerson Mnangagwa's zero-tolerance stance to corruption.
The law and order unit of the Criminal Investigations Department recently contacted Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya to seek the present-day value of the Zimbabwe dollar billions that Chombo received.
TRIAL DATES
Correspondence from the law and order unit to Mangudya, dated June 6 and seen by the Sunday Times, reveals that a new case is being put together against Chombo.
""This office is investigating a case of fraud in which the accused is Ignatius Morgan Chiminya Chombo. In December 2005, the accused obtained a loan of Z$14-billion from Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, which was facilitated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe under Other Crops and Livestock facility.
""The accused diverted the use of the money and went on to buy two Toyota Hilux double-cab vehicles, contrary to its intended purpose of purchasing farming equipment. We therefore request your good office to assist us with the current value of the Z$14-billion which was obtained by the accused in December 2005,"" the letter stated.
Lovemore Madhuku, Chombo's legal counsel, on Friday confirmed knowledge of the new charges against his client and said he would appear before the courts to face them.
""The matter is now before the courts, so I cannot comment on it, but we were in court and he was given trial dates,"" Madhuku said.
The trial is set down to begin on July 26.
Chombo, a leading light of the G40 faction in Zanu-PF that was pushing for the takeover of power by former first lady Grace Mugabe, was targeted in November by special forces of the military, and was held incommunicado for a week by soldiers.According to Madhuku, during that time, Chombo was beaten. He was arrested by police on his release and charged with fraud and abuse of office related to the time that he was the local government minister.
On July 18, Chombo will be in court for allegedly contravening sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He stands accused of prejudicing Eddie Pfugari Properties to the tune of more than $200-million in a botched land deal.
Chombo - along with former Zanu-PF youth leaders Kudzai Chipanga, Innocent Hamandishe and Mathew Nleya - is also accused of wearing the party's regalia without authority.
That case is also set down for July 26.
He will appear in court again on August 2 to answer charges of defrauding the City of Harare of property worth $900,000. His co-accused are Lazarus Chimba, Rejoice Pazvakavambwa and Psychology Chiwanga.
Chombo will be on trial on August 8 for allegedly defrauding businessman Chargan Vithal Rama of $500,000 in company share ownership transfer deal. The allegations are that in 2001, Rama got a 60-year lease for a farm expiring in 2054. It is alleged that, sometime in 2007 after spending $500,000 on setting up a fish farm, Rama ran out of money and approached banks for funding. The banks demanded surety in the form of title deeds for the land on which the fish farming was taking place.
The state alleges that in 2007, Rama, through the facilitation of his brother, Amrat Vithal, who at one time was a councillor in Chirundu, arranged for a meeting with Chombo at his office.
The aim of the meeting was allegedly to ask Chombo to facilitate the issuing of the title deeds.Chombo allegedly advised them that it was possible to get the title deeds on condition that Rama surrendered 25% of the business to him.
Chombo allegedly made it clear that the 25% was for the facilitation of the title deeds.
In 2014, Chombo was also reportedly under investigation for corruption by the CID over the unprocedural construction of a business complex that now accommodates Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe in Pomona.
In another case Chombo was also allegedly involved in the $80-million Airport Road, which has been shrouded in mystery over how Augur Investments was controversially awarded the contract when it was linked to his company.
In April Chombo's bail conditions were relaxed and he was given back his passport after Madhuku successfully applied to have his travel documents released in order for him to seek medical attention in South Africa.
Other charges he is facing include corruption that the state alleges cost it more than $3.6-million.
Political observers have expressed reservations about the number of cases piling up against former government ministers without being translated into convictions.
This, they say, risks dampening the crusade against corruption fronted by Mnangagwa.
Political analyst Alexander Rusero said the charges had failed to end in convictions, rendering the entire mantra against corruption as nothing more than grandstanding.
""It is politics, the objective has been achieved: disrupt G40 and scatter it all over. It explains why the cases are failing. It was and will remain politics.
""There is no political will by the new administration to follow through the high expectations which were there when they came into office,"" he said.",1
837,Billy McFarland (fraudster),"(born December 11, 1991) [1] [2] is an American convicted fraudster who co-founded the ill-fated Fyre Festival. He defrauded investors of $27.4 million by marketing and selling tickets to the festival and other events. [3]

In 2013, McFarland founded Magnises, a club targeted at millennials, using $1.5 million of investor funding. He later founded and acted as CEO of Fyre Media, which developed the Fyre mobile app for booking music talent. In late 2016, along with rapper Ja Rule, McFarland co-founded the Fyre Festival, a luxury music festival intended to promote the Fyre app. The event was scheduled to take place in April and May 2017, but was aborted after attendees had arrived due to problems with security, food, logistics, understaffing, accommodations, and talent relations.

In May 2017, McFarland and Ja Rule were sued for $100 million in a class action lawsuit on behalf of Fyre Festival attendees. The following month, McFarland was arrested and charged with wire fraud in Manhattan federal court for his role in the organization of the festival. [4] [5] [6] After pleading guilty to two counts of wire fraud in March 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison.

Early life and education[ edit ]

McFarland was raised in the Short Hills section of Millburn, New Jersey. [7] His parents are real estate developers. [8] At age 13, he founded an online outsourcing startup that matched clients with web designers. [7] He graduated from the Pingry School in 2010. [9] He then attended Bucknell University, where he would have studied computer engineering, but dropped out in May of his freshman year. [7] [10] [11]

Career[ edit ]

McFarland dropped out of college toward the end of his freshman year and founded the short-lived online advertisement platform Spling where he served as CEO. [7] [12]

In August 2013, McFarland seeded payments company Magnises with $1.5 million of investor funding, [13] [14] [15] aiming to create an exclusive ""black card"" with social perks, such as club membership, targeted at status-oriented millennials in certain big cities. [16] [17] McFarland also launched Fyre Media Inc., the parent company of the Fyre Festival. In a term sheet sent to investors, Fyre Media claimed to be worth $90 million. [18] By contrast, authorities allege the company did only about $60,000 in business. [19]

On July 23, 2018, The New York Post reported that Anna Sorokin, a fraudster and would-be socialite, may have lived at the SoHo loft owned by McFarland for four months after asking to stay for only a few days. The loft was also used as the headquarters for the defunct millennial black credit card company Magnises. [20] [21]

Fyre Festival[ edit ]

Main article: Fyre Festival

McFarland founded Fyre Media and publicized a luxury music festival in the Bahamas, called Fyre Festival, to promote the Fyre music-booking application. [5] The festival, to be held in April 2017, was advertised by a video which included a bevy of Instagram models including Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski who, along with Kendall Jenner, were all expected to be at the festival. However, the festival experienced a number of serious management, administration and misrepresentation issues and was canceled after guests had begun to arrive on Great Exuma island. Guests were met with tents and pre-packaged sandwiches instead of the lavish villas and meals they were promised. [22] The festival subsequently became the focus of U.S. federal investigations and multiple lawsuits. [23]

McFarland borrowed as much as $7 million in an effort to fund the festival, taking one loan with an effective annualized rate of 120 percent. [24] McFarland defaulted on the loan and the lender sued.

The controversy around Fyre Festival were detailed in two documentaries in 2019: Hulu released Fyre Fraud on January 14, and Netflix released Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, directed by Chris Smith, on January 18. [25]

Fraud conviction[ edit ]

On May 1, 2017, Fyre Festival organizers Billy McFarland and Ja Rule were sued for $100 million in a class action lawsuit in relation to the failed Fyre Festival that left attendees stranded on the island of Great Exuma without basic provisions. [26] In addition to the class action lawsuit filed in May 2017, six federal and four individual lawsuits were filed in relation to the scheme. [27] McFarland was arrested by federal agents on June 30, 2017, and charged with wire fraud in relation to Fyre and Fyre Festival. He was released on $300,000 bail on July 1. [28] McFarland faced up to four years and nine months under U.S. sentencing guidelines, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristy Greenberg. She added that McFarland's short but eventful career showed a ""pattern of deception"" and ""overpromising luxury experiences that were not delivered"". In July 2017, McFarland was represented by a public defender at a bail hearing after his previous legal team ""had not been paid enough to continue to represent him"". [28] McFarland later hired the private firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner as representation. [29]

In March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud in Federal Court in Manhattan and admitted to using fake documents to attract investors to put more than $26 million into his company. [30] He agreed to forfeit over $26 million. [31] On June 12, 2018, McFarland was charged with selling fraudulent tickets to events such as the Met Gala, Burning Man, and Coachella while out on bail. [32] On October 11, 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in federal prison. [33]

McFarland is currently incarcerated at FCI Elkton, in Lisbon, Ohio. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, McFarland requested compassionate release from prison to avoid contracting the virus. His request was denied the same month. [34] In July 2020 it was reported that McFarland has tested positive for COVID-19 at said facility. [35]",1
242,Has Indonesia gone soft on terrorism?,"On Monday June 29, Afif Abdul Majid, a longtime colleague and supporter of Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, was convicted by the Central Jakarta District Court of providing funds for a terrorist training camp in Aceh in 2010.
For this crime, the court sentenced him to four years' imprisonment. After subtracting time already served in custody, and remissions, this terrorist ideologue who publicly declared his support for the Islamic State (IS) movement, will likely be free in a couple of years.
The decision, which has received surprisingly little media attention, is indicative of some serious flaws in Indonesia's approach to counter-terrorism. Ustad Afif was convicted by the court of donating funds for a paramilitary training camp in Jalin Jantho, Aceh, in circumstances in which 'it was known, or ought to have been known' that they would be used for terrorism.
The chief judge, from a panel of three, in handing down the court's verdict and sentence, appeared at pains to point out two things:
First, that the offense included circumstances where the defendant ought to have known that the money would be used for terrorism ' even if he didn't, in fact, know.
And second, that if the defendant didn't agree with the verdict, it was not final and could be appealed. 'I reject this decision and I didn't know the money would be used for terrorism', Afif cried out at the conclusion of proceedings to a court room packed with his militant, shouting supporters.
Much was made of this by the prisoner's defense counsel, Achmad Midan, outside the courtroom. To argue that Afif was unaware that the money would be used for the terrorist training camp is absurd.
Since the formation of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), Ba'asyir's phoenix that rose from the ashes of Jamaah Islamiyah, Afif has been there by his side. A 2010 report of the private International Crisis Group noted that at JAT's inauguration event in Bekasi in September 2008, 'Ba'asyir was the major attraction, but Afif Abdul Majid was the man in charge'.
To argue that Afif was not aware and complicit in the planning of the terrorist training camp for which Ba'asyir is serving 15 years imprisonment, is an untenable, apologist stance. The judge made no attempt to reprimand the prisoner for his actions and missed the opportunity to point out, to a room full of his supporters, the dangers of the ideology he espouses or the influence he wields over his followers.
The fact that Afif was convicted at all is something of a triumph. We could ask why it took police and prosecutors five years to bring the charges for financing the camp in Aceh against him. But in a way it is a good thing that they did. Because that charge was bundled together with other charges relating to his involvement with, and support for, the IS movement.
When an IS recruitment video appeared on YouTube in August 2014 urging Indonesians to join the fight in Syria, the previous administration moved quickly to 'ban' the organization. However, in the absence of any supporting laws or regulations, the police were left facing a legal vacuum.
On several occasions they arrested IS supporters only to later release them for lack of a law to charge them under. Indonesia's best legal minds were asked for a solution. Some suggested revoking the Indonesian citizenship of anyone who declared allegiance to IS.
Another suggestion was to link the actions of IS supporters here to the brutal, terrorist acts of IS in Syria and Iraq, and charge them under Indonesia's anti-terrorism law, which has extra-territorial effect. Yet another, more creative, idea was to dust off a colonial-era law which criminalizes acts of rebellion, or makar, against friendly states.
Afif's was the first case to come before the Indonesian courts which involved charges linked to IS and was therefore something of a test case for how Indonesia's laws could cope with the IS situation.
They did not pass the test.
In addition to funding the Aceh camp in 2010, Afif also faced charges relating to late 2013/early 2014, when he travelled to Syria, joined IS, undertook military training, pledged allegiance to the self-proclaimed caliph, and then returned to Indonesia and started speaking publicly about how great IS is and how people should go there and support it. All these facts are freely admitted by the defendant himself.
Accordingly, prosecutors charged him with 'conspiracy, attempt or aiding' the commission of terrorism, and with the 'rebellion against a friendly state' offence ' in this case, the friendly state being Syria. Despite the defendant's admissions, and the valiant attempts of the police and prosecutors, Afif avoided all the IS-related charges.
The court found simply that there was insufficient evidence of involvement in violent acts to convict the defendant, and gave the matter no further discussion or attention.
The real failure here lies with the state of the law. Despite repeated calls from various commentators and stakeholders, the laws have not been revised or amended to deal with the rise of the IS phenomenon. If police had a clear offence with which to charge anyone who purports to be a member, or supporter of IS, they would have a much better chance of obtaining convictions.
As it is, they have very little chance, and influential and dangerous supporters of IS are able to evade prosecution. In that sense we were lucky that the prosecutors had an ace up their sleeve in the 'financing Aceh' charge. If not for that, Afif would have walked from the court room a free man.

135,Lexington federal judge sentences two people in romance fraud that led to money laundering | #onlinescams | #scams | #internetscams,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (WTVQ/U.S. DOJ) – Two defendants were sentenced in federal court Friday, for their roles in an international money laundering conspiracy; a third was convicted last Friday, by a federal jury in Lexington, for his role in the scheme.

Last week, after an hour of deliberations, following a three-day trial, a federal jury convicted 34-year-old Baaki Abdul Majeed of wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and five counts of transactional money laundering.

According to testimony at trial, Majeed conspired with Kahad Wuupini, 35, and Thomas Inkoom, 42, in a money laundering conspiracy.

Evidence revealed that the conspirators agreed to aid in and launder $757,000 in funds, which were defrauded from a victim of an online romance fraud scheme.

After receiving cashier’s checks, personal checks, and cash from the victim, Majeed and his co-conspirators laundered the money from Washington and New Jersey, back to Ghana, by purchasing cars that were shipped to Ghana, obtaining cashier’s checks, and wiring funds to each other or other individuals in the United States and Ghana.

The purpose of these transactions was to conceal and disguise the proceeds of their online romance fraud.

Majeed, Wuupini, and Inkoom were indicted in August 2019.

Wuupini and Inkoom pleaded guilty to the money laundering conspiracy in March 2020 and were sentenced Friday, by Chief U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves.

Wuupini was sentenced to 79 months in prison and Inkoom was sentenced to 19 months.

Under federal law, both must serve 85 percent of their prison sentences and will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for 3 years, following their release.

Wuupini was ordered to pay $757,000 and Inkoom was ordered to pay $100,000 in restitution.

“The scheme, using fraud and deceit, preyed upon the victim’s hopes and took advantage of her kindness, ultimately stealing over $750,000 of her money,” said Robert M. Duncan, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky.

“Unfortunately, internet-based romance scams are becoming more and more prevalent. It is important for people to be cautious about sending money to someone they have only met online,” he said. “If something seems too good to be true, it often is. I commend the hard work of FBI personnel and members of my Office, to hold the defendants accountable for their crimes, and to bring a measure of justice to the victim.”

“Romance scammers use promises of love and romance to entice victims online often persuading them to send money, personal and financial information, and items of value to the perpetrator,” said James Robert Brown, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, FBI, Louisville Field Office. “The defendants in this case not only deceived a vulnerable individual, but then proceeded to engage in multiple money laundering schemes in order to conceal their original scam. The FBI will not stand for fraudsters who seek to gain financially by preying upon the ‘heartstrings’ of Americans.”

United States Attorney Duncan and Special Agent in Charge Brown, jointly announced the conviction.

The investigation was conducted by the FBI. The United States was represented in the case by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kate Smith.

Majeed will appear for sentencing on January 29, 2021.

He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.",1
53,Fannie Mae Slammed With $400M Fine,"Fannie Mae said its board has read the report and is committed to making the changes required under the deal with the regulators.

""We are glad to resolve these matters. We have all learned some powerful lessons here about getting things right and about hubris and humility,"" Mudd said in a statement. ""We are a much different company than before. But we also recognize that we have a long road ahead of us.""

The accounting manipulation tied to executives' bonuses occurred from 1998 to 2004, according to the report, a much longer period than was previously known.

Regulators had earlier said that Fannie Mae in 1998 improperly put off accounting for $200 million in expenses to future periods so executives could collect $27 million in bonuses.

The manipulation ""made a significant contribution"" to the compensation of former chairman and chief executive Franklin Raines, which totaled more than $90 million from 1998 to 2003, the report says, including some $52 million directly tied to the company hitting earnings targets.

The agency first discovered in 2004 the accounting-rule violations and alleged earnings manipulation to meet Wall Street targets — disclosures that stunned the financial markets.

In December 2004, the SEC ordered Fannie Mae to restate its earnings back to 2001 — a correction expected to reach an estimated $11 billion. The Justice Department has been pursuing a criminal investigation.

Raines and former chief financial officer Timothy Howard were swept out of office by Fannie Mae's board in December 2004.

OFHEO levied a record $125 million fine in 2003 against Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae's smaller rival in the multitrillion-dollar home mortgage market, for misstating earnings — mostly underreporting them — by $5 billion for 2000-2002.

On Friday, Fannie Mae said it was replacing the chairman of its board's audit committee, a key position as the second-largest U.S. financial institution reworks its accounting and struggles to emerge from the scandal.

The company said the board had named accounting professor Dennis Beresford to replace audit committee chairman Thomas Gerrity.",1
617,Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling Resentenced to 168 Months on Fraud and Conspiracy Charges,"WASHINGTON—Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey K. Skilling has been resentenced to 168 months in prison on conspiracy, securities fraud, and other charges related to the collapse of Enron Corporation. In addition to the prison sentence, Skilling, 59, was ordered to forfeit approximately $42 million to be applied toward restitution for the victims of the fraud at Enron.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Criminal Division made the announcement after Skilling was resentenced before U.S. District Judge Sim Lake at the U.S. District Court in Houston.

“The sentence handed down today ends years of litigation, imposes significant punishment upon the defendant, and precludes him from ever challenging his conviction or sentence,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Raman. “With today’s court action, victims of Skilling’s crimes will finally receive more than $40 million that he owes them. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of all the prosecutors and agents who have handled this important case from the initial investigation to today’s successful conclusion.”

A federal jury found Skilling guilty in Houston on May 25, 2006, of one count of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities fraud, one count of insider trading, and five counts of making false statements to auditors. Judge Lake initially sentenced Skilling to serve 292 months of imprisonment on October 23, 2006. On January 6, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed Skilling’s convictions but vacated his sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court of appeals concluded that the district court erred by increasing Skilling’s sentence for having substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution—that is, Enron’s pension plan. As a result, the court of appeals effectively reduced Skilling’s guidelines range of imprisonment by approximately nine years.

In May 2013, the government and Skilling entered into an agreement to recommend jointly to the district court a sentence between 168 months and 210 months of imprisonment, a limited reduction in Skilling’s guidelines range of imprisonment in exchange for Skilling agreeing, among other things, not to contest the original forfeiture and restitution order and to waive all appeals and other litigation. As court documents make clear, the government entered into this agreement, in part, to bring finality to Skilling’s convictions and thereby allow the government to promptly seek the distribution of approximately $42 million to victims of Skilling’s crimes.

Skilling’s convictions stemmed from a scheme to deceive the investing public, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and others about the true performance of Enron’s businesses. The scheme was designed to make it appear that Enron was growing at a healthy and predictable rate, consistent with analysts’ published expectations, that Enron did not have significant write-offs or debt and was worthy of an investment-grade credit rating, that Enron was comprised of a number of successful business units, and that the company had an appropriate cash flow. This scheme had the effect of artificially inflating Enron’s stock price, which increased from approximately $30 per share in early 1998 to over $80 per share in January 2001, and artificially stemming the decline of the stock during the first three quarters of 2001.

The fraud scheme eventually unraveled, and Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, making its stock virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron’s collapse was conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and special agents from the FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation. The task force received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The resentencing hearing was handled by Patrick Stokes, Albert Stieglitz and Robert Heberle of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.",1
845,Edward Davenport and five others convicted in Gresham advanced fee fraud,"A guilty plea entered today at Southwark Crown Court completes the prosecution of six defendants over two trials in a £4 million commercial loans advance fee fraud between 2006 and 2009 operating as Gresham Ltd. With reporting restrictions now lifted the convictions of Edward Davenport, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen in May can now be published alongside the convictions of David Horsfall , Richard Stephens and David McHugh who all pleaded guilty before the second trial, due to commence today.

Trial 1

The first trial, presided over by HHJ Testar, involved the three defendants who directed and operated the fraud, Edward Davenport, Peter Riley and Borge Anderson. They were the driving force behind Gresham Ltd, a company promoted falsely by them as a long-established, wealthy and prestigious financial organisation capable of lending hundreds of millions of pounds as venture capital.

The three were convicted on 19 May of conspiracy to defraud. Sentencing was held over until 1 September. Davenport and Riley were each sentenced to 7 years, 8 months and disqualified from acting as company directors for ten years. (see note 1).
Andersen's sentencing was adjourned awaiting a pre-sentencing medical report and on 12 September he was sentenced to 3 years, 3 months and disqualified from acting as a company director for 7 years.
The SFO will seek Serious Crime Prevention Orders against all three defendants. Confiscation proceedings will also be taken against all three defendants.

Trial 2

The second set of proceedings under HHJ Higgins involved a solicitor and two individuals purporting to be professional advisors engaged by Gresham to support the façade. David McHugh, an individual with several previous convictions for dishonesty, posed as both a lawyer and accountant in order to deceive investors. Richard Stephens posed as a surveyor to convince investors their projects were being properly considered. David Horsfall, a solicitor, provided misrepresentations to investors as to Gresham's ability to advance loans.

David McHugh and Richard Stephens pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud.
David Horsfall pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation, contrary to s1 of the Fraud Act 2006.
These defendants will be sentenced on 10 November 2011. (See Note 2 for ages and residences of all six defendants).

Background

Gresham, a London based operation, purported to offer the sourcing and provision of commercial funding by way of loans or joint venture capital, for which ""advance fee"" payments were sought from individuals. (This Gresham is not to be confused with a similarly named business - see note 3.) It was set up by Davenport who in 2005 bought a near-worthless company registered many years earlier, Industrial Design and Finance, and renamed it Gresham Ltd. His company brochure described the business as having a ""consistent record of trading…"" over the ""last 50 years"". He recruited Peter Riley to run the company on the day-to-day basis, to meet prospective clients and sign the loan agreements. Davenport remained however, the ""supreme leader"", as described by one of the conspirators in a recovered email. Andersen joined Gresham in February 2008 to become Riley's principal lieutenant, signing agreements and fobbing off concerned applicants with bogus explanations for delays in provision of funding.

The dishonest representations which underpinned the Gresham operation included claiming that it had particular experience and expertise in the field of multi-million pound commercial finance, claiming that it had access to a number of sources of funds that were available to fund projects of the type that were being presented and claiming that it had a successful track record of arranging funding for clients. Solicitor David Horsfall, a long-time associate of Davenport (and who had acted for him in High Court litigation relating to his acquisition of the former Sierra Leone High Commission premises at Portland Place in 2000) added a professional reassurance to prospective applicants seeking confirmation of Gresham's ability to advance substantial loans. He also falsely claimed he had transacted loan agreements and dispersed money for Gresham.

David McHugh pretended to be a qualified lawyer and an accountant of 35 years experience. He traded as Touchstone Accountants and Touchstone Law. In reality he was not enrolled or qualified in either profession. He entered into the Gresham conspiracy in early 2008 and amongst the various deceptions he contributed to the fraud was the preparation of false company accounts

After persuading victims to seek finance, Gresham would proceed to obtain the advance fee from the applicant as an absolute priority and before taking any further step on the applicant's behalf. This would be followed with a range of deceptive assertions and claims designed to extract further monies from the applicant by way of deposits, fees for bridging loans or fees for insurance policies.

Having obtained the fees, further deceptions were made to convince the applicant that genuine and positive steps were being taken to provide the funding that they were seeking. When the applicant complained about the speed of progress or the lack of results, a range of tactics and excuses were deployed deflect the client from appreciating the true situation. An example is where Riley blamed delays on a fictitious Monaco financier called Louis Martin, even setting up an email address of that name and sending reassuring messages from it to applicants.

Riley and Stephens were old friends. The fraud used loan documentation templates from a previous similar dishonest scheme that Stephens (under the name of Kirkup) was involved in. Stephens joined in the conspiracy in 2007, following his release from prison, taking on the role of ""surveyor"" to visit the sites of the proposed building projects in order to give the impression that proper and professional procedures were being undertaken and as a pretext to demand ""due diligence"" fees which in some cases for site surveys were over 50,000 euros.

The defendants relied upon the fact that there was a worldwide demand by those either already in business, or wanting to go into business, for finance for commercial enterprises and willing to pay a fee in advance to acquire a loan. Often clients required 100% (or close to 100%) funding and they had frequently already exhausted conventional lending sources before approaching Gresham.

Gresham took advantage of the ""credit crunch"" that took that hold from 2007 onwards and when conventional sources of commercial financing became scarce. Holding itself out as a funding source in such an economic climate was a powerful draw for entrepreneurs who were keen to get their projects off the ground.

Loans were typically sought for construction projects in the UK and continental Europe, but also in North America, India and in the Caribbean. The fees were sought under a variety of pretexts, ranging from ""verification"" fees to ""guarantee"" fees. Most significant, and indeed profitable for the defendants, however, were demands for ""due diligence"" and ""deposit fees"". The latter were claimed necessary to raise the loan.

The loans Gresham claimed to be able to provide amounted to many hundreds of millions of pounds. Yet of the numerous victims contacted by the SFO not one received the monies promised. More than £4m in fees were taken from over a hundred applicants.

Proceedings

The SFO investigation opened in September 2009 following complaints made by victims. Searches of the defendants' commercial and residential properties were undertaken in December 2009. These searches involved 70 SFO personnel and 40 City of London police officers. The investigation was also supported by Cheshire and Derbyshire police forces. The defendants were charged soon after the searches.

Trial 1, which was presided over by HHJ Testar, commenced in January 2011 with guilty verdicts returned on 19 May and sentences passed on 1 and 12 September. Reporting restrictions were ordered because further court proceedings were scheduled for other defendants.

Trial 2 opened today, 5 October, where Horsfall pleaded guilty and with Stephens and McHugh already having admitted their guilt.

The Director of the SFO, Richard Alderman, commented ""This was a proactive investigation that stopped a sophisticated criminal enterprise in its tracks. The time taken from the commencement of the investigation to trial was a little over fifteen months and demonstrates the SFO's commitment to reducing the time taken to bring cases before the Crown Court.""

In passing sentence in trial 1, HHJ Testar described the Gresham operation as a ""professional and sophisticated fraud that did a huge amount of damage…victims suffered crippling losses"". He described Riley as ""a very accomplished con-man…at the sharp end of the fraud"" who had ""spun a web of elaborate lies to explain why the money had not come. It was one fictitious charade after another"" and enabled Riley to enjoy ""a dolce vita life"".

The judge described the SFO's description of Davenport as ""the ringmaster"" as ""justified"". He said that Davenport was in overall charge and though he worked in the background (""he doesn't leave footprints in the snow"") he was the instigator and the instructor. Andersen was described as a less senior participant, receiving less benefit and that ""the fraud was already a runner"" before he joined Gresham.

294,Paradise Lost: Costa Rica Falls Victim to Corruption and Clientelism,"The ‘Switzerland of the Western Hemisphere’ is being severely shaken by numerous allegations of political corruption.
At least three former presidents have been accused of heavy involvement in bribery scandals, with possibly more to come if the 1970s and 80s are scrutinized.
Current President Abel Pacheco and numerous other government officials are also under investigation.

On October 8, former Costa Rican president Miguel Angel Rodríguez resigned as Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) just three weeks after he had been installed in his new post. He stepped down after allegations surfaced accusing him of fraud while serving as Costa Rica’s president. Rodríguez’s downfall has sent shockwaves throughout the hemisphere, particularly in his native land, where an alarming trend of past corruption and scandal among the nation’s top officials has become evident in the last few months, although, in reality, widespread corruption has been infecting the country for years.

Smug Costa Rica has long been considered, perhaps quixotically, to be a model for the Western Hemisphere regarding its peaceful demilitarization, an extensive and efficient social service net, low levels of violence and exceptionally high literacy rates. As such, Cost Rica was thought to be far above the bribery and rampant corruption that have plagued its more venal neighbors. Yet the recent release of credible evidence that four presidents, as well as numerous high ranking administrators, have been involved in money laundering has done immense damage to this perception. If the litany of scandals continues, many believe that Costa Rica will run the risk of mortally damaging its squeaky-clean reputation and perhaps endanger some of its democratic institutions, not to mention the rapidly degrading image of the region in general. Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo and former Honduran President Rafael Callejas both have been recently investigated for corruption. Additionally, former Guatemalan Vice President Francisco Reyes is currently imprisoned on corruption charges. Regional leaders are also surely keeping an eye on the developing crisis in Ecuador, where President Lucio Gutiérrez’s cabinet is rapidly dissolving as he faces possible dismissal for the alleged misappropriation of campaign funds. Finally, former Salvadorian President Francisco Flores—a candidate for the top post in the OAS—has been accused, but not yet charged, with fraud involving two banks (CREDISA and CREDICLUB), money laundering and defaulting funds from the National Administration of Aqueducts and Sewers—not small allegations against a would-be hemispheric leader.

Telecommunications Fraud
Meanwhile, allegations of corruption against Rodríguez first materialized last June during his confirmation as OAS Secretariat. Suspicions arose when José Antonio Lobo— Rodríguez’s protégé and a former director of the state electrical company, Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)—was arrested in connection with a bribery scheme involving the French telecommunications company Alcatel. In an effort to improve Costa Rica’s cellular phone capabilities, contract bids were issued during Rodríguez’s term to a number of international telecommunications firms. Two firms in particular, Alcatel of France and Nokia of Finland, vied for this lucrative deal, with Alcatel eventually prevailing. However, in early 2004, details surfaced that Alcatel officials had been awarded the contract after successfully bribing Lobo with a $2.4 million “prize”. Lobo, now under house arrest, claims that he only accepted the sum after being advised to do so by Rodríguez. According to Lobo, Rodríguez not only encouraged the transaction, but also demanded that 60 percent of it be deposited into a Washington bank account under his wife’s name; he allowed Lobo to keep the remaining 40 percent.

Alcatel has a history of attempting to influence Costa Rican politicians. Connections going back to José María Figueres, another former president, forced him to step down from his position as second-in-command of the World Economic Forum in Geneva on October 29. His resignation came after accusations arose of a $900,000 bribe he received from the corporation during his years of public service in Costa Rica.

Alcatel supposedly had invested $800,000 in companies linked to Hernan Bravo, director of the ICE from 1998 through 2004. In return, Bravo saw to it that the company was awarded two more large contracts to develop cell phone lines, the most recent contract reportedly being worth $149 million. In a rather ironic twist, current Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco, the most vocal critic of Rodríguez during his abbreviated stint as OAS Secretary General, has yet to explain the undeclared $100,000 donation to his presidential campaign by Alcatel. In all, authorities believe that Alcatel has paid a total of $4.4 million to various Costa Rican officials, resulting in its being assigned a near monopoly of telecommunication services in the country.

Taiwan Connection
Perhaps the most prevalent of the current corruption charges swirling through Costa Rica involves Taiwan, a nation that has always had a very amicable, if well-greased relationship with this and other Central American and Caribbean countries (the smaller the better, as long as they have a vote in the OAS and UN). Rodríguez’s personal Panamanian-based investment company, Denisse, received two payments of $500,000 from the Friendship Company, which has strong ties to the Taiwanese government. In addition, as president, Rodríguez received $200,000 from Taiwan on two separate occasions—in 2001 from the Taiwanese foreign minister and again in 2002 from its embassy in San José. Last June, Rodríguez was questioned about several mysterious donations of up to $500,000 to his political party, the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC), from companies with Taiwanese connections.

The Taiwanese government also has invested more than $4.8 million in Costa Rica, supposedly for development and tourism. These funds, however, actually went into 34 foreign ministry employees’ paychecks rather than being invested in the Costa Rican economy. Because of its diplomatic isolation brought on by Beijing’s aggressive foreign policy, Taiwanese officials chronically find it advisable to buy influence throughout the Caribbean basin by bribing venal local leaders and entering into sweetheart contracts with their officials, with the hope of bringing about diplomatic recognition of national sovereignty for the island.

Fraudulent “Plan Finland”
Another piece of chilling evidence has emerged to the embarrassment of former Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderón. Project Finland began as a component of a $39.5 million loan promised to Costa Rica by the Finnish government. The deal was intended to subsidize Costa Rica’s state-run Social Security System, Caja, by improving its medical technology. Apparently, Calderón received a large sum laundered through the Costa Rican pharmaceutical company, Corporación Fischel, whose funds originated from Project Finland. The Project Finland arrangement in turn was agreed to by Helsinki on the condition that the Central American country would purchase at least 50 percent of its medical equipment needs from Finland. Eliseo Vargas, the Caja executive who had pushed for Plan Finland in 2001, was arrested on October 3, 2004 for attempting to interfere with a government investigation. Meanwhile, Calderón, who previously was thought to have stood aloof from the Finnish deal while serving as president from 1990-1994, is now being investigated for his illicit receipt of $440,500. Though Calderón has admitted to having received the aforementioned funds, he sheepishly argues that the money was legitimately earned by him, comparing his revenues to that of a fortunate stockholder, rather than a defalcating head of state.

What Next?
These incidents have caused Costa Rica to suffer a plummet in its international prestige, as well as in its own self-image. In fact, serious talks about corruption go back to at least the middle of the 1970s, featuring the National Liberation Party (PLN) presidency and its leader, President Daniel Oduber. Perhaps most telling is the country’s significant decline on the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (TICPI). While Costa Rica was ranked 22 in the world in 1997, it was ranked 41 as of Oct 21, 2004, still a relatively generous mark in light of the spate of recent allegations against the nation’s highest officials. Humiliating reports such as this may partially help explain Costa Ricans’ resolve to see that those responsible for such scandals are suitably punished, for failure to do so would further trash the country’s already savaged reputation. On October 12, thousands of indignant ticos marched in a peaceful demonstration in San José to protest the current sordid state of political affairs in the country. Costa Rica’s Congress also has taken action to ensure that scandals like these do not continue to escalate. Anti-corruption legislation recently has been passed and signed into law by President Pacheco. There is even discussion of additional legislation that would ban any country participating in such unscrupulous under-the-table deals from trading with Costa Rica for the next ten years. Taiwan would be a central focus for such a measure because of its extensive role in money laundering and for purchasing diplomatic influence in order to neutralize Beijing.

Costa Rica is currently one of only 26 countries that recognize Taiwan’s autonomy from China, but now there is a demand by many in the political opposition that all relations with Taipei be severed. Officials involved in these crimes cannot expect immunity, as exemplified by the swift action taken against two of its former presidents. Rodríguez was forced to return to Costa Rica after his disgraceful OAS exit, where he was summarily arrested and jailed on October 29 and is awaiting trial within the next six months. Calderón was also jailed at the end of October, but a judge has reduced his initial nine month sentence to two months and he can expect to be released on December 22. Perhaps such rapid punishment caused Figueres, who initially had promised to return to the country by December 1, to send a 15-page letter to the Costa Rican Congress on November 30, declaring his intention to remain in Geneva. His refusal to return indicates that the retribution process may be much slower than Costa Ricans would like.

Considering the initial shock that swept through the hemisphere in response to the continuing revelations surrounding malfeasance in office in Costa Rica, one could assume that an urgent message of alarm is being recorded there, as well as elsewhere in the region. Costa Rica, which has always thrived on its putative democratic bona fides, is now being seen as not particularly different from the other transgressor nations, but instead as a chronic victim of massive corruption. If the country’s ill-regarded judiciary and lackadaisical legislature can be used to effectively eradicate the systemic dishonesty from its current political system, Costa Rica may yet be able to offer a possible example to its neighbors of how to redress crooked governance.",1
117,"Former MPD Officer Derek Chauvin In Custody, Charged With Murder In George Floyd’s Death","MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested four days after George Floyd’s fatal arrest that sparked protests, rioting and outcry across the city and nation, and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced he has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

On Friday, John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, announced that Chauvin, 44, of Oakdale, was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, who said that Chauvin was arrested in Minneapolis. There was some speculation that he had gone to a home in Florida.

“We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we did not have all that we needed,” Freeman said, before saying that he was unable to speak to specific pieces of evidence and which one specifically was needed to file charges.

“This is by far the fastest that we’ve ever charged a police officer,” Freeman said.

WHAT THE COMPLAINT SAYS

A criminal complaint released Friday afternoon details the events that unfolded on May 25:

Officers were dispatched to Cup Foods on the report of a man buying merchandise with a counterfeit $20 bill. Shortly after 8 p.m., Officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng arrived with their body cameras activate and recording.

The officers learned from store workers that the man, later identified as Floyd, was parked in a car around the corner.

Body camera footage shows the officers approaching the car with Lane on the driver’s side and Kueng on the passenger side. Three people were in the car: Floyd, another man and another woman.

As Lane began speaking with Floyd, he pulled out his gun, pointed it at Floyd and ordered him to show his hands. Floyd then put his hands on the steering wheel and Lane holstered his firearm.

Lane then ordered Floyd out of the car and handcuffed him, but Floyd “actively resisted being handcuffed,” the complaint states. Once handcuffed, however, police said Floyd did not resist and walked with Lane to the sidewalk. Floyd then sat on the ground at Lane’s direction.

The complaint says Lane spoke with Floyd for under two minutes, asking Floyd for his identification and name. He also asked Floyd if he was “on anything” and told Floyd he was going to be arrested for passing counterfeit currency.

Then, Lane and Keung stood Floyd up and attempted to take him to their squad car. Floyd then “stiffened up, fell to the ground and told the officers he was claustrophobic,” the complaint states.

That’s when Officers Chauvin and Tou Thao arrived on the scene in a separate squad car.

After making several attempts to get Floyd in the backseat from the driver’s side, the complaint says Floyd wouldn’t get in and would struggle with the officers by intentionally falling down.

The complaint says that Floyd began saying and repeating he could not breathe while standing outside the car. Chauvin then went to the passenger side and tried to get Floyd in from that side, with Lane and Keung assisting.

Chauvin then pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the car at 8:19 p.m. and Floyd went to the ground face down while still handcuffed.

While Keung and Lane held Floyd’s back and legs, Chauvin “placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck.” Floyd could be heard repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe”, as well as “mama” and “please.” The officers, however, stayed in their positions.

The officers told Floyd, “You are talking fine”, as he continued to struggle. At one point, Lane asked “should we roll him on his side?” To which Chauvin responded, “No, staying put where we got him,” the complaint states.

Lane then said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever” to which Chauvin responded, “That’s why we have him on his stomach.” They continued holding their positions.

At 8:24 p.m., Floyd stopped moving. Kueng then checked Floyd’s right wrist for a pulse and said “I couldn’t find one.” The officers continued to hold their positions.

At 8:27 p.m., Chauvin removed his knee from Floyd’s neck as medics arrived. Floyd was taken away in the ambulance. He was pronounced dead at Hennepin Healthcare.

An autopsy report is pending, but the Hennepin County Medical Examiner did release these findings: There were no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation, and that Floyd had underlying health problems, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease.

According to the medical examiner, “the combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,” the complaint states.

The complaint determined that Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of that time was after Floyd became unresponsive.

“Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in prone position is inherently dangerous,” the complaint said.

If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 25 years in prison on the murder charge and up to 10 years in prison on the manslaughter charge. No court appearance has been set. Click here for a link to the complaint (.PDF).

MORE DETAILS/CHARGES EXPECTED IN GEORGE FLOYD CASE

Freeman says the other officers involved in the fatal arrest are under investigation and that charges are expected.

“But I’m not going to get into that,” he said. “Today, we’re talking about former officer Chauvin.”

Mayor Jacob Frey called the decision to charge “an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.”

“What’s happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,” Frey said. “For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage.”

The FBI, meanwhile, is seeking photos/video from those who witnessed the incident to support the federal civil rights investigation into Floyd’s death. Witnesses with digital media can go here: FBI.gov/MinneapolisTips

Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd’s family, released a statement on their behalf, saying that they were expecting first-degree murder charges.

“We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,” the statement said.

A first-degree murder charge carries a mandatory life sentence in Minnesota.

Attorney General William Barr issued a statement Friday afternoon, saying:

The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing. The state prosecutor has been in the process of determining whether any criminal charges are appropriate under state law. On a separate and parallel track, the Department of Justice, including the FBI, are conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible. Under our system, charging decisions must be, and will be, based on the law and facts. This process is proceeding quickly. As is the typical practice, the state’s charging decisions will be made first. I am confident justice will be served.

Chauvin is the former officer in the video seen around the world with his knee on Floyd’s neck for at least five minutes. He’d been with Minneapolis police for 19 years.

Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, video obtained by CBS News shows Floyd cooperating with officers, at least in the initial moments of the encounter.

A bystander’s video showed Floyd pleading that he could not breathe as a white officer — identified as Chauvin — knelt on his neck and kept his knee there for several minutes after Floyd stopped moving and became unresponsive.

The incident drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after being placed in a police chokehold. He also said the words “I can’t breathe” while being arrested. The phrase has become a rallying cry for protests over police brutality. The video circulated widely on social media, sparking protests in Minneapolis and cities across the country.

On both Tuesday and Wednesday, protests began with peaceful demonstrations near where Floyd was pinned to the ground, but violence later broke out near the 3rd Precinct police station. Wednesday evening’s protests involved more than 30 fires, destruction of businesses and looting.

Unrest was more widespread Thursday night, with destruction spreading to St. Paul, where more than 170 businesses were damaged. In Minneapolis, rioters burned the 3rd Precinct police station.

Earlier Friday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the looting and arson must come to an end so that state can address the problems that led to Floyd’s death.

“We cannot have the looting and recklessness that went on,” he said. “It’s time for us to clean our streets.”

At that same press conference, Harrington, the commissioner of public safety, called Floyd’s death a murder.

“That’s what it looked like to me,” he said. “I’ll call it as I see it.”

Floyd’s death is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, FBI in Minneapolis and the Department of Justice Civil Rights division.",1
423,Former Ukrainian President Poroshenko faces charges over corruption and “high treason”,"Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is facing a range of criminal corruption charges opened by the country’s State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) last month.

The 11 charges were first revealed in July just prior to the parliamentary elections, suggesting that the timing of the accusations was meant to further damage the chances of Poroshenko’s already ailing European Solidarity Party. The party ended up winning just 25 seats compared to 254 for President Volodomyr Zelensky’s Servant of the People Party.

It was later revealed by Roman Truba, the head of the SBI, that Poroshenko was aware of the charges and had already submitted requests to delay questioning by the Bureau for several weeks.

The charges stem from lawsuits filed by lawyer Andriy Portnov, who previously served as a deputy in the administration of Viktor Yanukovych. The latter was toppled in the Western-backed fascist coup in 2014 that brought Poroshenko to power.

Among the multitude of charges being investigated include claims that Poroshenko—a billionaire chocolate manufacturing tycoon—evaded taxes during the sale of a television station and that he spent $500,000 of state money on an illegal and secret personal vacation to the Maldives in January 2018.

Portnov has also claimed that Poroshenko committed high treason by staging a deliberate provocation in the Kerch Strait incident in the Azov Sea November 2018 when 24 Ukrainian sailors aggressively confronted a Russian ship and were later captured. According to Portnov, Poroshenko planned to use the subsequent declaration of martial law to postpone elections, ban opposition parties, and remain in power, a claim that was widely circulated throughout the country prior to the first round of presidential elections in March.

The Ukrainian billionaire Sam Kislin, a former advisor to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, traveled to Ukraine this past week to speak with Ukrainian investigators. Speaking with Ukraine’s Strana.UA news website, Kislin claimed that Poroshenko had siphoned $8 billion in state funds through the state-owned Centerenergo company and the importation of coal from the United States and South Africa at inflated prices. Kislin also claimed that Poroshenko is facing criminal charges in courts in the United States but gave no details.

Poroshenko has already spoken with investigators on several occasions. Each time when leaving the building of the SBI he has been accosted by protesters. Ukrainian courts have given permission to investigators to request that Poroshenko take a lie detector test, which he has so far not consented to.

In addition to the investigation led by the SBI, this week a court in Kiev ordered Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau to open an investigation against Poroshenko and former Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin on charges of abuse of power. The government is also investigating the mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, a major figurehead in the 2014 coup, for “corruption.”

There is little doubt that Poroshenko, a member of the oligarchic class that enriched itself off the privatization and plundering of state assets, is a criminal. Poroshenko—who was overwhelmingly voted out of office in April—is widely hated and despised by the vast majority of the Ukrainian working-class for his blatant corruption, xenophobic nationalism and far-reaching assaults on living standards during his time in power from 2014 to 2019.

The charges against Poroshenko give an inkling of the depth of criminality in a government that was brought to power by a coup that was fraudulently portrayed as a “democratic revolution” by the imperialist powers and the Western bourgeois media. Now, the same media that portrayed Poroshenko as a warrior of democracy and published article after article about the corruption of Yanukovych, have maintained an almost complete silence.

The Trump administration has been trying to protect the stooge in Kiev who played a critical role in the US-led anti-Russia campaign and war preparations. After the announcement of an investigation into Poroshenko, the US’s special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, held a meeting with the billionaire and other leaders of his European Solidarity Party leaders where they promised to continue to fight for “Ukraine’s interests” against Russia.

Lending his support to Poroshenko, Volker claimed during the meeting that “the last five years had been the most productive over the entire period of independence, both for building the state and for strengthening the partnership between Ukraine and the United States.”

Vesti Ukrain e has also reported that Poroshenko has been using the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm BGR Group, where Volker is a senior advisor, to help convince American lawmakers to support him should he be arrested by the Zelensky government.

The report also raised the possibility that Poroshenko may flee to Washington, as former Georgian President and American-backed stooge Mikhail Saakashvili did when he faced legal prosecution by an incoming opposition government in 2013.

But however despicable Poroshenko and however likely his corruption (and other crimes), the political forces behind the criminal proceedings against him are just as reactionary. The Zelensky government is making use of corruption charges to settle accounts within the ruling class—a well-trodden path in the fractional battles within the oligarchy in Ukraine and elsewhere.

According to Deutsche Welle, Andriy Bohdan, Zelensky’s chief of staff, “has long been a friend” of accuser Portnov. Furthermore, Portnov returned from exile in Russia the day after Zelensky’s inauguration to make his accusations, further suggesting that the case against Poroshenko is part of a well-orchestrated plan by Zelensky and his supporters to crush Poroshenko and his party as a political rival and further increase their grip on the reins of state in Kiev.

In doing so, the Zelensky government is consciously appealing to and whipping up the far-right forces that helped Poroshenko come to power but have since fallen out with him and his administration.

Several news reports suggest that the fascist Azov Battalion, which played a critical role in the 2014 coup and the Ukrainian state’s war against the Russian-backed East Ukrainian separatists, are backing the criminal proceedings against Poroshenko.

During the presidential campaign earlier this year, the Azov Battalion had assaulted and accosted Poroshenko several times, forcing him to flee his own election meetings. In late July, the Azov Battalion attacked Poroshenko’s car.

In the multiple physical and verbal attacks by the Azov Battalion and similar fascist forces on Poroshenko, his corruption and the alleged failure of the Ukrainian army to sufficiently wage war against separatists in the Donbass has figured prominently.

Three members of the Azov Battalion warned in a YouTube video earlier this month that if Zelensky would not put Poroshenko behind bars they would take care to punish him for “crimes against the nation, against the army and against Ukraine”.

The Zelensky administration has conspicuously not moved against the country’s Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov, who has faced similar corruption accusations in the past but is a longtime political rival of Poroshenko. Avakov, who oversees the country’s police and has well-known ties to the Azov Battalion and others on the far right, continues to serve in Zelensky’s administration.",1
928,Finland jails police chief Aarnio for drug-smuggling,"Published

image copyrightAFP

A Finnish court has sentenced the former head of Helsinki's anti-drugs police to 10 years in prison for drug-smuggling and other offences.

Jari Aarnio was found to have helped a gang to import nearly 800kg (1,764lb) of hashish from the Netherlands and sell it in Finland in 2011-2012.

Aarnio, 59, was found guilty of five drug crimes and 17 other offences.

These included trying to frame an innocent man for being in charge of the drug ring.

An accomplice of the former senior policeman, described as a top local criminal, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Aarnio spent 30 years in the anti-drugs force and was arrested in 2013.

He denied all the charges against him, claiming his actions were all legal and undertaken in a policing capacity.

His legal team said Aarnio plans to appeal the district court's sentence in the Helsinki Court of Appeal.

In a separate case in September, Aarnio was sentenced to three years in jail for fraud.",1

Endo shares were down 53 cents, or 11.8%, at $3.98 in late afternoon trading, with much of the decline coming after New York announced the charges.

29,Gold trader says he made 'maybe $150 million' from plot to beat Iran sanctions,"New York (CNN) (CNN) -- An Iranian-Turkish gold trader admitted in a US court that he made ""maybe $150 million"" by helping Iran dodge international sanctions.

It's a colossal take for a minor Turkish tabloid celebrity who, for years, escaped prosecution in his own country and now faces years in US prison.

Reza Zarrab, once the lead defendant in a widespread money laundering investigation, has pleaded guilty to money laundering and bank fraud among other charges, according to court documents.

He is now the US government's star witness in the New York criminal trial of his alleged counterpart -- a Turkish banker named Mehmet Hakan Atilla who until recently was Zarrab's co-defendant. Atilla has pleaded not guilty.

On Tuesday, his fifth day of testimony, Zarrab estimated how much he made by laundering Iranian money for six years until he was arrested in Miami in 2016.

""I don't remember exactly,"" Zarrab said. ""It could be $100 million. It could be more than that, maybe $150 million.""

He said that ""after paying commission for the bank and other bribes,"" he was left with a cut of 0.4%, equal to $4 on every $1,000.

Massive fraud 'wildly possible'

Although Zarrab has not said how much Iranian money he illegally moved through international banks, an 0.4% cut matching his payout would mean that he helped Iran move $25 billion to $37 billion -- an astonishing number for a black-market operation spearheaded by a single man.

That figure has not appeared in court documents. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York did not immediately provide responses to CNN's questions about the scale of the alleged fraud.

One expert on Iranian sanctions said the $37 billion total was ""possible ... maybe more like wildly possible.""

""I continue to be surprised how large the profit and level of financial sanctions evasions are. But this would be a stretch ... so I'd be skeptical,"" said George A. Lopez, a professor at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

However, several United Nations reports on the effect of Iranian sanction do indicate that a single person could help Iran launder huge amounts of money. The UN Panel of Experts reports describe how in 2011 ""a local businessman"" in one country faked documents to transfer $1 billion from Iran's central bank to countries around the world.

During previous testimony in court, Zarrab said that Iran had $3 billion at the Turkish state-owned Halkbank. It was those accounts that Zarrab says he was tasked with emptying to move Iranian funds.

In a written statement, Halkbank denied the accusations: ""Our bank did not do any illegal transfers about any country. There is no systematic or conscious violation in order to bypass the embargo.""

Money paid for prostitutes

Atilla's defense lawyer, Cathy Fleming, appeared to attack Zarrab's integrity by questioning him on Tuesday and Wednesday about how he spent his riches.

Zarrab admitted that in 2013 he paid for prostitutes to satisfy ""others,"" likely business partners and clients.

He also said he was carrying $102,000 when he was arrested in March 2016 -- cash that the international bank fraudster and money launderer planned to spend on a family trip to Walt Disney World.

""This was the money needed for our 10-day trip for seven individuals,"" Zarrab said.

He also admitted that, while in a US jail, he used his Turkish lawyer to funnel $45,000 to a US prison guard. It was a bribe so that he could sneak alcohol into the jail and use the guard's cell phone to call family members in Turkey.

Zarrab also admitted paying other jail inmates to use their phone time when his own 300-minute allotment was up.

Rape allegation

The closely watched trial took an unexpected turn Wednesday evening, when Zarrab was sued by a former jail inmate who accused him of rape.

The inmate is a man from Ivory Coast who recently pleaded guilty to providing ""material support"" to a terrorist organization; he had connected the Colombian guerilla group FARC with a weapons dealer.

According to the man's lawsuit, Zarrab raped him, assaulted him with his hands, and sodomized him with a cucumber when they shared a cell earlier this year at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center.

Zarrab's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, told CNN by email: ""Mr Zarrab vehemently denies this outrageous and patently false allegation. He intends to vigorously defend against this offensive lawsuit.""

Last week, Zarrab implicated top Turkish government officials when he testified that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister at the time, personally intervened in the scheme -- as well as former Turkish economy minister Zafer Caglayan.

Also last week, Erdogan said Turkey ""did the right thing"" and did not violate US sanctions against Iran, according to CNN Turk. Caglayan denied all allegations in a Turkish probe into these allegations that started in 2013.

The accusations have set off a diplomatic spat between Turkey and the United States. Turkey claims the current American trial is a ruse meant to damage Turkish politicians, and its government has retaliated by moving to seize Zarrab's assets.",1
941,"Treasury Department, HSI sanction significant members of MS-13 gang","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, with the assistance of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), designated six members of the notorious El Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) Wednesday.

The designation is pursuant to Executive Order 13581, which targets transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and their supporters. This executive order is a key part of the National Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime.

These actions are part of the Treasury Department's ongoing efforts to target the leadership of global criminal organizations, including MS-13, which threaten innocent people and legitimate business around the world, including in the United States.

In October 2012, MS-13 became the first transnational criminal street gang to be designated by Treasury as a TCO. MS-13 has been involved in serious criminal activity, in the United States and around the world, including human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion and immigration offenses.

""Today's designation of six MS-13 leaders is the result of Homeland Security Investigation's National Gang Unit and OFAC's joint partnership to further strike at the financial heart of one of the most dangerous transnational criminal gangs in the world today,"" said ICE Director John Morton.

""This powerful tool will provide HSI and its local, state, federal and international law enforcement partners to further disrupt MS-13 financial networks and violent operations,"" Morton continued. ""History has proven that we can successfully take down organized crime groups when we combine sophisticated investigative techniques with tough street level enforcement, cutting off cash flows, contraband and collaborators to ensure they no longer find safe haven in our communities.""

""MS-13 is an extremely violent and dangerous gang responsible for a multitude of crimes that directly threaten the welfare and security of U.S. citizens, as well as peoples throughout Central America,"" said Adam Szubin, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to target the leadership and financial networks supporting MS-13, and work with our law enforcement partners from across the United States and around the world to disrupt their criminal activities.""

The designations of six individuals working for, or on behalf of, MS-13 are designed to further disrupt the activities of MS-13 and to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse.

As active members and leaders, these individuals are heavily involved in directing and participating in illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, and murder.

Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34, incarcerated in El Salvador, is widely regarded as the Central American leader of the group and frequently acts as the spokesperson for the MS-13 gang in El Salvador.

Several other MS-13 leaders — including Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa Larios, 39; Moises Humberto Rivera Luna, 44; and Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35 — have been indicted in the United States for racketeering, murder and other violent crimes. Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon, 28, has been involved in narcotics trafficking operations on behalf of the organization. Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 36, is both an MS-13 crime boss and a narcotics trafficker.

MS-13 consists of more than 30,000 members and operates in at least five countries, including the United States. It is one of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world today. MS-13 promotes its illicit interests through murder, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion and assassination, including carrying out numerous murders within the United States.

U.S. persons and businesses are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

The HSI National Gang Unit is the lead law enforcement agency under this MS-13 enforcement effort dubbed ""Operation Barbed Wire."" The National Gang Unit removes gang members from local neighborhoods and, when appropriate, from the United States. Their goal is to deter, disrupt and dismantle gang operations by tracing and seizing cash, weapons and other assets derived from criminal activities.

In 2005, HSI initiated Operation Community Shield, an international law enforcement initiative to enhance U.S. public safety. Operation Community Shield partners with existing federal, state and local anti-gang efforts to identify violent street gangs and develop intelligence on gang members and associates, gang criminal activities and international movements; to arrest, prosecute, imprison and/or deport transnational gang members; and to suppress violence and prosecute criminal enterprises.

Since 2006, HSI has arrested 4,249 MS-13 gang members and, partnering with the U.S. Department of Justice, has successfully brought to indictment numerous MS-13 racketeering investigations in Washington, Virginia, New York, San Francisco, Houston and Atlanta.",1
420,Gwynedd fraudster jailed for £6m money launder conspiracy,"A man has been jailed after he admitted conspiring to money launder nearly £6m.

Michael Kinane, 41, of Porthmadog, Gwynedd, was caught following a joint FBI and British police inquiry, Operation Blue Coastal.

The email systems of London-based pharmaceutical investment company Avillion were infiltrated, with requests for payments to be made.

At Caernarfon Crown Court, Kinane was sentenced to seven years and eight months in prison.

He had previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to money launder and three counts of fraud.

The targeted company was working with a US investor when fake emails were sent to staff, requesting money for legitimate work, to be paid into new accounts - one of which was Kinane's.

On 2 November 2018, the company deposited $7.8 million into his NatWest account.

Kinane, a British citizen born in Sri Lanka, had set up two foreign currency accounts.

Between 2 November and 5 November 2018, funds arriving in Kinane's accounts were separated between his associates to accounts in Poland, Germany, Hong Kong, China and Malaysia.

Judge Nicola Jones said she accepted he had not orchestrated the scheme, but was motivated by ""greed"".

""You played a key role in laundering this money, took great care to ensure the optimum amount could be moved between bank accounts.

""This was motivated by greed and I'm not sure you showed genuine remorse.""

image copyrightPolice photo

Kinane also organised fraudulent purchases of high-value cars.

Funds were also transferred to separate accounts belonging to Kinane which were linked to a business he was the sole director of.

Identified as Magic Lily Ltd, it was alleged to have operated from his home address in Porthmadog.

Police inquiries identified that the company existed, but did not have any stock, did not trade and did not file accounts or pay corporation tax.

Kinane was arrested on 8 August 2019 as he got off a plane from Turkey at London Gatwick Airport.

At the time of his arrest, police said he was wearing a Tag Heuer watch valued at £4,550.

He was also in possession of documents identifying he had recently invested the equivalent of £30,000 into a Dubai-based company.

North Wales Police have obtained banking documents for 32 accounts attributable to Kinane so far.

The 13-month investigation has resulted in the recovery and return of £1.2m ($1.6m) to the victim.

Avillion said it was ""pleased justice has been done"" and was in the process of recovering the money, adding it had consulted with experts to improve its cyber security.

Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney said: ""This case has been solved because of the support we have received from the companies concerned, the work of the FBI in their parallel investigation and the excellent support we have received from the specialist fraud division of the Crown Prosecution Service in Merseyside.""",1
526,U.S. Designates 17 Individuals Linked to AL Qaida Designation Supports Actions Taken by Italy and Germany,"JS-458

WASHINGTON, DC � Highlighting international cooperation in fighting the financing of terror, the U.S. Treasury Department today joined Italy in designating 16 individuals associated with the Algerian based Armed Islamic Group (GIA). In addition, Treasury designated Abdelghani Mzoudi, a member of the Hamburg, Germany, al Qaida cell that planned the September 11th attacks on America, in support of German action against Mzoudi. With the support of the United States, Italy and Germany have submitted these names to the United Nations 1267 Committee.

�These designations signal continued commitment and momentum within the international community to shut down the funding of terror. I applaud the Italians and Germans for taking action against these individuals,� U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow stated.

Today's action is one of many the U.S. has taken in collaboration with our international partners. Most recently, on May 29, the U.S. joined several European countries in designating the al-Aqsa International Foundation, a charity funding Hamas. In addition to Italy and Germany, we have taken joint actions with Saudi Arabia, Australia, the European Union, the G7, and others. If there are no objections from the UN 1267 committee, all UN member states will be required to designate these 17 individuals on Tuesday.

A list of those designated is attached. These designations prohibit transactions between U.S. persons and these individuals and freeze any assets in the United States. Additional background materials are available by calling Treasury Public Affairs.

Trouville, Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Miami Field Division and Paul I. Perez, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida (MDFL), announced that Joaquin Mario Valencia-Trujillo, of Cali, Colombia, was sentenced in federal court, in Tampa, for his role as a Colombian cocaine kingpin. Valencia-Trujillo was sentenced to a prison term of 40 years and ordered to forfeit $110 million. Valencia-Trujillo was convicted, in was charged in August 2002 with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to import cocaine, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. After his arrest in Bogotá, Colombia, in January 2003, Valencia-Trujillo was extradited to the MDFL.

During the four month trial, government witnesses depicted Valencia-Trujillo as the cocaine supplier for Salvatore Magluta and Guillermo ""Willie"" Falcon, dating back as early as the late 1970s. Testimony further described Valencia-Trujillo as the supplier of more than 100 tons of cocaine annually to the U.S. since the early 1990s until his arrest in January 2003. In accordance with the extradition agreement with Colombia, the jury's verdict and the court's sentence were based solely upon Valencia-Trujillo's post December 17, 1997 activities.

Mr. Perez stated, ""The Valencia-Trujillo case serves as another example of the cooperation and commitment of the United States and Colombia to the counterdrug effort. The human misery and societal cost for which this defendant is responsible is immeasurable. The punishment is well-deserved and long overdue."" The investigation and prosecution was the result of the efforts of agents and analysts from the DEA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Sarasota County Sheriff's Office and the Colombian National Police.",1
550,Goldman Sachs 1MDB settlement: a meaningful punishment for major financial crimes?,"Late last month, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a landmark settlement with banking giant Goldman Sachs over its participation in a massive bribery scheme that syphoned hundreds of millions from Malaysian public coffers. As a part of a deal with prosecutors, the Wall Street firm agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to authorities in multiple countries, and agreed to have its Malaysian subsidiary plead guilty in a Brooklyn court to conspiring to violate U.S. bribery laws.

The fine, the largest ever under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act followed the indictment of two Goldman executives who U.S. authorities alleged pushed the bribery ring.

The scandal focused on a multi-billion dollar fund known as 1MDB, which was ostensibly devoted to developing the Malaysian economy. Instead, billions were illicitly syphoned from the fund, often via offshore accounts, to wealthy elites, politicians and Goldman bankers. Some of the looted money is suspected to have financed the film production of “Wolf of Wall Street,” the Hollywood feature starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

In its action against Goldman, U.S. authorities used a controversial tool called a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, in which an offending firm pays a fine and agrees to a period of probation in order to avoid the potentially ruinous prospect of being criminally prosecuted.

Critics say that the U.S. legal system’s increasing reliance on DPAs to address financial crime reflects its softness on corporate executives, who can often safely assume that they will not face jail time for white-collar misconduct.

In September, ICIJ published the FinCEN Files, a global investigation detailing trillions of tainted dollars moving through major U.S. banks. In many cases, huge amounts of suspicious money flowed through institutions that had already been subjected to DPAs for money laundering. To some critics, the findings epitomized the toothlessness of DPAs and their inability to deter corporate crime. “They’ve become in effect the cost of doing business rather than a real punishment,” Jed Rakoff, a senior federal judge in Manhattan, told ICIJ.

The DOJ got a bad name because, in a lot of cases, no one in the company was being held to account, but this shows an effort to do that.
— Paul Pelletier, former federal prosecutor

The Goldman DPA is part of a sprawling global enforcement action against the bank, and offers a mix of elements that reflect both unusually aggressive tactics by U.S. prosecutors toward a financial firm while also containing classic hallmarks of prosecutorial timidity, according to experts.

Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who has been a vocal critic of the heavy use of DPAs, says that the government’s action against Goldman has plenty to laud, even for a critic like himself. Pelletier says he is impressed that the government actually prosecuted two Goldman bankers who were allegedly at the heart of the bank’s involvement with 1MDB. In November 2018, the Justice Department indicted Timothy Leissner, a former Goldman partner, and Roger Ng, a former Goldman managing director, for arranging bribes and laundering money in relation to their work with 1MDB. Leissner pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing while Ng maintains his innocence and is expected to take his case to trial next year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“When a company does a DPA, they are acknowledging that someone in the company was acting criminally,” Pelletier said. “The DOJ got a bad name because, in a lot of cases, no one in the company was being held to account, but this shows an effort to do that.”

Yet others have questioned whether the Justice Department’s action against Goldman ultimately amounts to a meaningful punishment, given the scale of the bank’s wrongdoing.

What stands out about the DPA to Brandon Garrett, a law professor at Duke University who has extensively studied corporate prosecutions, is the size of the fine: he says it looks surprisingly small. U.S. prosecutors, according to Garrett, took a number of steps favorable to Goldman in calculating the fine, including deducting penalties the bank had paid foreign regulators from its own fine.

The Trump administration has vowed to grant corporations more of such deductions for what it calls the “piling on” of fines from multiple law enforcement agencies when a scandal engulfs a company. Such deductions are one reason for a dramatic reduction in corporate penalties in recent years, according to the New York Times.

“It looks like a big payment, but it’s actually a fairly good deal for Goldman Sachs,” Garrett said. Last month it was reported that, in the third quarter of this year alone, Goldman Sachs earned $3.6 billion in profits – more than the sum laid out in the Justice Department’s DPA.

Garrett said that the U.S. portion of the fine was “far below” the federal guidelines on what the government could have fined Goldman for the massive theft it admitted to aiding. Garrett says that federal prosecutors granted Goldman “credits” for favorable behavior during the investigation – although “it isn’t exactly clear what that credit was for.” The DPA states that Goldman had only partially cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation. At points, the bank dragged its feet on providing key information and failed to self-report FCPA breaches that it knew had occurred, according to the filing.

“Self-reporting is incredibly important,” Garrett said. “There should be an identifiable consequence for failing to self-report. Here, I don’t think there was.”",1
593,Another former South Korea president jailed for corruption,"TOKYO — Former South Korea president Lee Myung-bak was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Friday for corruption, the latest in a string of former leaders of the country who have faced similar charges after leaving office.

He was also fined 13 billion won ($11.5 million).

Lee, 76, a conservative politician and former Hyundai executive, served as president from 2008 to 2013, when most of the crimes took place. His successor Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 25 years prison in August in a separate corruption scandal, after being ousted from office last year following months of street protests.

Lee was convicted of taking millions of dollars in bribes from businesses and other sources and for also using a private auto-parts company as a channel to embezzle tens of millions more.

Lee was not present at the verdict, with his lawyer citing poor health as well as the court’s decision to allow live television coverage. He had previously denied the charges, and claimed they were politically motivated and brought by the current liberal government of President Moon Jae-in.

[ Presidential scandal shows that ‘Korean disease’ is far from cured ]

South Korea moved from military dictatorship to democracy in the late 1980s, but its political system continues to be undermined by high-level corruption and collusion between the political elite and the powerful business sector.

A succession of presidents have vowed to strengthen the battle against corruption, only to later become embroiled in scandals involving themselves, family members or key aides as they left office or after surrendering power.

While in office, Lee’s government had initiated a corruption investigation into former liberal president Roh Moo-hyun in 2009, after which Roh committed suicide. Lee claims the case against him is an act of revenge by Moon, who was Roh’s chief of staff. Moon has angrily rebutted those charges.

Lee was found guilty of a string of offenses, including selling a presidential pardon to Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who had been convicted of tax evasion, as well as siphoning off money from the country’s intelligence agency and taking bribes in return for favors from business figures and others.

Ironically, South Korea scores relatively well on international rankings for bribery at lower levels of society, with police and teachers generally not taking backhanders, in contrast to some other Asian countries, said Kim Geo-sung, a former head of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.

“There is little corruption at the lower level,” he said. “But it is totally different at the higher levels of power. Politicians make very bad decisions.”

Moon won last year’s election on a promise to root out the nexus of corruption between the political and business elites, and he proposed revising the constitution to, among other things, reduce the power of the president over the judiciary and the president’s power to pass special pardons. But his attempt to pass a constitutional amendment was blocked by conservative lawmakers.

Two other former presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, both former army generals, were convicted of corruption and other offenses in 1997, although they were both pardoned the same year.

868,Pakistan court convicts Mumbai ‘mastermind’ in terrorism case,"Islamabad, Pakistan – A Pakistani anti-terrorism court has sentenced Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba armed group, to five and a half years’ prison in a case related to terrorism financing, his lawyer says.

Saeed was convicted and sentenced on two counts by a court in the eastern city of Lahore on Wednesday, Imran Gill, the lawyer, told Al Jazeera.

He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for being a member of a “proscribed organisation” under Pakistani law, and another five years for a charge related to “illegal property”, Gill said.

Abdur Rauf Wattoo, the government’s prosecutor in the case, confirmed the verdict, adding that Saeed’s associate Zafar Iqbal had also been convicted and sentenced to the same term.

The arrest and charging of Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed more than 160 people, has been a long-standing demand of the United States and Pakistan’s neighbour India.

The 70-year-old says he is not linked to any armed group, although he heads Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the charitable arm of the LeT group. Both the JuD and LeT are “banned organisations” under Pakistani anti-terrorism law.

Saeed’s conviction comes days ahead of a key meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental watchdog that monitors terrorism and criminal financing laws, in Paris.

FATF will be issuing a decision on whether Pakistan has taken sufficient steps to avoid being “blacklisted”, a designation that would come as a blow to the South Asian nation’s struggling economy.

A FATF blacklisting would put in place barriers that would serve to isolate Pakistan’s economy from the international banking system, introducing stricter checks and safeguards on transactions involving the country.

Saeed was indicted in December on six charges under anti-terrorism laws, with verdicts still due in four cases.

“Section 11-N of the Anti-Terrorism Act deals with possessing property, facilitating and fundraising … if a proscribed person or organisation holds a property, then that is considered to be for the purpose of terrorism,” said Wattoo, the prosecutor.

“So on that basis the court has found sufficient evidence and convicted Zafar Iqbal and Hafiz Saeed on two counts each.”

First conviction since 2008 attacks

LeT is accused of operating with impunity from Pakistani soil to attack Indian security and government targets in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan and India both claim the mountainous territory of Kashmir in full, but administer separate portions of it.

They have fought two of their three wars over the territory, with India accusing Pakistan of also supporting armed groups like LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad that attack Indian targets in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan denies the charges, saying it has been acting against all armed groups operating on its soil.

Wednesday’s development is the first time Saeed has been convicted on any charges since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

In December 2014, a Pakistani court granted bail to Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, another senior LeT commander, in a case related to the Mumbai attacks, saying there was not enough evidence to continue to hold him.

Saeed says he is no longer associated with LeT, and claims JuD only conducts humanitarian aid work. JuD and its Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) have operated a network of dozens of schools and hundreds of ambulances, providing humanitarian relief in all four Pakistani provinces.

The UN has long designated the JuD and FIF as fronts for the LeT.

Last year, under pressure after the FATF review, Pakistan formally banned Saeed’s JuD and other associated organisations, after years of allowing them to operate freely across the country.

Saeed remains in custody, and will now be shifted to prison, as verdicts in the four remaining terrorism financing cases are expected later this week.",1
850,Samsung Group titan Lee Kun-hee dies aged 78,"Reuters

Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of South Korea's largest conglomerate, Samsung Group, has died aged 78.

Mr Lee helped to grow his father's small trading business into an economic powerhouse, diversifying into areas like insurance and shipping.

During his lifetime, Samsung Electronics also became one of the world's biggest tech firms.

He was the richest person in South Korea, according to Forbes, with a net worth of nearly $21bn (£16bn).

Samsung said Mr Lee died on Sunday with family by his side, but did not state the exact cause of death. A heart attack in 2014 had left him living in care.

""All of us at Samsung will cherish his memory and are grateful for the journey we shared with him,"" the firm said in a statement.

Mr Lee was the third son of Lee Byung-chul, who founded Samsung Group in 1938. He joined the family firm in 1968 and took over as chairman in 1987 after his father's death.

At the time, Samsung was seen as a producer of cheap, low-quality products. But under his leadership radical reforms were introduced at the company.

Mr Lee became famous for telling employees in 1993: ""Let's change everything except our wives and kids."" The firm then burned its entire mobile phone stock, consisting of 150,000 handsets.

Mr Lee rarely spoke to the media and had a reputation for being a recluse, earning him the nickname ""the hermit king"".

Samsung is by far the largest of South's Korea's chaebols - the family-owned conglomerates that dominate the country's economy.

Chaebols helped to drive South Korea's economic transformation after World War Two, but have long been accused of murky political and business dealings.

Mr Lee was twice convicted of criminal offences, including the bribing of former President Roh Tae-woo.

He stepped down as Samsung chairman in 2008 after he was charged with tax evasion and embezzlement. He was handed a three-year suspended jail sentence for tax evasion but was given a presidential pardon in 2009 and went on to lead South Korea's successful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics.

He returned as chairman of Samsung Group in 2010, but was left bedridden by the 2014 heart attack.

Mr Lee's son, Lee Jae-yong, has served jail time for his role in a bribery scandal which triggered the ousting of then-President Park Geun-hye from office in 2017. Last month, prosecutors laid fresh charges against him over his role in a 2015 merger deal.",1
775,Treasury Sanctions Los Zetas Contraband Trafficker,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Eduardo Mendoza Robles (a.k.a. Zeta 33) as a specially designated narcotics trafficker (SDNT) pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Mendoza Robles is responsible for transporting drugs, weapons, and cash across the U.S.-Mexico border on behalf of the Los Zetas cartel. Today’s action prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with Mendoza Robles, and freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Mendoza Robles is a drug and weapons trafficker working on behalf of Los Zetas, relying on multiple individuals to smuggle contraband in both directions across the U.S.-Mexico border. In July 2012, Mendoza Robles, along with other members of Los Zetas, was indicted in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Laredo Division, for conspiracy to export arms.

“Today’s designation targets a major trafficker who has incessantly exploited the U.S.-Mexico border through the illicit movement of narcotics, weapons, and cash,” said Treasury’s OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Robles’s activities have fueled violence and crime, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and expose such operations.”

Today’s announcement follows the designation last month of Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez as a SDNT. Rios Hernandez is the wife of Mexican drug lord Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, the jailed leader of Los Zetas. President Obama identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009, and, in July 2011, he named Los Zetas as a significant Transnational Criminal Organization pursuant to Executive Order 13581.

“Freezing assets of international drug traffickers like Eduardo Mendoza Robles is yet another superior example of how U.S. law enforcement agencies, working together, continue to relentlessly combat international drug cartels and violent criminals on all fronts,” said the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) Houston Field Division, Acting Special Agent in Charge Steven S. Whipple.

The designation of Mendoza Robles was done in close coordination with the DEA, Laredo Division.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.",1

The SFO alleged the trio had diverted money from the Axiom Legal Financing Fund for their own benefit.

The accused's lawyers have been contacted for comment.

The case is listed for September 30 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.",1
541,North golf professional jailed for £150k VAT fraud,"A golf professional who ran his own course and then pocketed more than £150,000 in VAT has been jailed for 15 months.

Inverness Sheriff Court heard that 51-year-old Jon Wiggett did not lead an affluent lifestyle.

He was desperate to keep his business at Brahan Golf club outside Conon Bridge in Easter Ross going and used it to keep the club afloat.

His lawyer, solicitor advocate Mike Chapman, told Sheriff Gordon Fleetwood: “The business was a spectacularly unsuccessful venture and instead of closing it down he used the VAT money to keep it going.

“He didn’t have expensive holidays and there are no assets to speak of. He has been unable to pay off any of the money and is realistic about his prospects today.

“But he is concerned about going to prison because his wife, a Swiss lady, has no support network in this country.”

In March, Mr Chapman persuaded Sheriff Sara Matheson to allow his client to keep his freedom for a little longer to safeguard his wife, Claudia’s, accommodation.

Mr Chapman explained that the land on which Brahan Golf Club is situated was leased from the Brahan Estate.

The lease also included the Wiggett’s house which is run as a bed and breakfast by them.

Mr Chapman said: “He needs time to get his affairs in order before a likely custodial sentence is imposed. The land will be returned to grazing for a local farmer but extensive fencing is required and my client has to provide it.

“Since he has no money to pay someone, he has to do the work himself which will take three to four weeks and then that will allow his wife to continue living in the house and running her business.”

Sheriff Matheson agreed to postpone dealing with Wiggett until April 14. However the Covid crisis intervened and Wiggett appeared for sentence yesterday.

At an earlier hearing, the court heard that he admitted fabricating VAT returns with false invoices and defrauded the Inland Revenue of £154,091 between November 2013 and January 2017, paying the money into his own account.

Depute fiscal Karen Aitken said: “HMRC officers based in their Inverness office contacted Jon Wigget in February 2017 to arrange to visit his premises to inspect his books and records on April 25, 2017.”

The golf club premises were searched on October 17, 2017, and various items relating to the business were seized along with a laptop computer.

Investigations revealed that invoices were fraudulently created and a subsequent examination of the laptop revealed the invoices were stored there.

Sheriff Fleetwood told Wiggett there was no alternative to a custodial sentence, adding: “This was all about getting money into your own account when it should have been going into the public purse.”

Cheryl Burr, assistant director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said: “Wiggett stole the equivalent of five police constables’ salaries in Scotland. This was money that should have been funding vital public services.

“Tax fraud is a serious crime and I ask anyone with information about those who may be involved to call our fraud hotline on 0800 788 887 or contact us online.”",1

An Inland Revenue adviser who did not pay income tax for 13 years has been jailed, with a judge saying sparing him from custody would cause ""outrage"".

Amjad Khan, 38, failed to pay almost £16,000 between 2002 and 2015 while working for the HMRC in Bradford.

He also pocketed nearly £24,000 in tax credits to which he was not entitled as part of the ""appalling and blatant"" fraud.

Khan admitted the fraud offences at Bradford Crown Court last year.

At the same time as he was working for the HMRC in Bradford city centre, the married father-of-three was also earning money through a property rental business and his work as a self-employed gas and heating engineer.

'Public would be outraged'

Prosecutor Howard Shaw said Khan of Burnett Avenue, Bradford, had claimed in a tax return for the year 2014/15 that both his businesses were loss-making even though analysis of his bank accounts showed they were profitable.

Defence barrister Emma Downing said a constructive alternative to immediate custody could include unpaid work for the community.

However, the Recorder of Bradford, Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC, said all the time Khan had been working for HMRC advising people about their ""rights and wrongs"" he had been committing fraud against the state.

""You were evading income tax over a 13-year period,"" said the judge, who described the frauds as ""appalling and blatant"".

The judge said a 20-month prison sentence would have to be served and the public would be outraged if the court did not deal with Khan in a robust way.

Khan is expected face a further hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act later in the year in bid to get back the money he obtained through fraud.",1
224,Treasury Expands Sanctions Against the Los Zetas Drug Cartel,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez and her medical supply company Distribuidora e Importadora de Productos Medicos del Norte as specially designated narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez is the spouse of Mexican drug lord Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, a leader of Los Zetas drug cartel, who is jailed in Mexico and faces multiple federal indictments in the United States for narcotics and money laundering violations. Prior to his arrest, Miguel Trevino Morales, along with his brother, Omar Trevino Morales, directed the vast drug trafficking activities of Los Zetas, one of Mexico’s most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations.

Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez owns and operates Distribuidora e Importadora de Productos Medicos del Norte, a company involved in the importation, distribution, and sale, of medical supplies in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez incorporated this company in 2009 and is its principal shareholder. Today’s action, pursuant to the Kingpin Act, prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with Juanita del Carmen Rios Hernandez or her company, and freezes any assets she or her company may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

“OFAC will be relentless in sanctioning Los Zetas’ leadership and associates to weaken and ultimately collapse the financial infrastructure of this ruthless cartel,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “This action builds on the consistent efforts of Treasury and our U.S. and Mexican law enforcement partners to target those operating on behalf of Los Zetas.”

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009. On July 24, 2011, the President named Los Zetas a significant Transnational Criminal Organization in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations). OFAC designated Los Zetas leaders Miguel and Omar Trevino Morales on July 20, 2009, and March 24, 2010, respectively. On July 15, 2013, Mexican authorities arrested Miguel Trevino Morales. Today’s action was undertaken with the support of the Government of Mexico.

Los Zetas distribute narcotics and launder tens of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds from international drug sales. Today’s action is OFAC’s fifth designation in a string of actions since last year aimed at Los Zetas leadership. In 2013, Treasury aggressively targeted Los Zetas with four separate designation actions. On August 1, 2013, Treasury designated Carolina Fernandez Gonzalez, wife of Zeta boss Omar Trevino Morales, her father, Jesus Fernandez de Luna, and his cattle sales company, Compania Ganadera 5 Manantiales. Omar Trevino Morales established this company for his wife and her father-in-law as a money laundering front to be used by Los Zetas. Through this and other actions, Treasury exposed various aspects of Los Zetas activities, including its bulk cash and drug smuggling operations, its international financial operations, and the businesses used by Los Zetas leaders to launder their illicitly gained funds.

Earlier, in 2012, OFAC designated Francisco Colorado Cessa and his oil services company, ADT Petroservicios, for laundering Los Zetas drug proceeds through the purchase of valuable quarter horses for Miguel Trevino Morales and Omar Trevino Morales. These designations were made in coordination with money laundering charges filed against Colorado Cessa and others in the Western District Court of Texas, Austin Division. In 2013, Colorado Cessa was convicted and sentenced to a 20-year prison term.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.",1
58,"Benjamin Netanyahu indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced Thursday, prolonging the country’s political uncertainty as it looks set to head into its third national election in a year.

Netanyahu, who has denied any wrongdoing and said he is the victim of a ""witch hunt,"" faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum 3-year term for fraud and breach of trust, according to legal experts.

""I give my life to this state, I fought for it, I was wounded for it. I have to say this is a very hard day,"" Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address on Thursday night. ""I think you need to be blind to see that something wrong is going on. This is a political coup.""

The prime minister insisted, without presenting evidence, that the indictment is a political vendetta.

""It’s very disturbing what is going on here and how the police conducted this investigation,"" Netanyahu said. ""This is a contaminated process, we need to investigate the investigators, they didn’t want the truth, they were after me personally.""

Netanyahu's chief political rival, former army chief Benny Gantz, said the indictment raises concerns that the prime minister ""will make decisions in his own personal interest and for his political survival and not in the national interest.""

The two were virtually tied after September’s elections and each failed to assemble a governing majority.

Israel’s attorney general announces plans to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

Feb. 28, 201901:01

The move to indict Netanyahu was a ""heavy-hearted decision,” Mandelblit told reporters on Thursday, in rejecting allegations the case is politically motivated.

In February, Mandelblit announced he was considering indicting Netanyahu on one count of bribery and three counts of fraud and breach of trust, in three different cases. The cases are known as Case 1000, Case 2000 and Case 4000.

Case 1000 alleges that Netanyahu received gifts, including cigars and champagne, worth “hundreds of thousands of shekels” from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and other supporters.

Case 2000 alleges that Netanyahu worked out a deal for favorable coverage with Arnon ""Noni"" Moses, the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, in exchange for backing a bill that would weaken a rival newspaper.

Case 4000 alleges that Netanyahu made regulatory decisions that favored the Bezeq telecommunications group in exchange for positive coverage on the news website Walla.

The indictment comes while Netanyahu is serving as Israel's caretaker prime minister after he failed to cobble together a government last month.

Netanyahu had hoped to pass legislation that would prevent him from being indicted but has been unable to do so because he failed to form Israel’s next government following the Sept. 17 election.

""What I’m going through is not easy ... on my family day after day, the blood of my family is poured,"" Netanyahu said Thursday night. ""I’m not willing to succumb and let there be such injustice, I will continue to lead the country.""

Netanyahu called for an independent committee to evaluate the charges and evidence against him.

""I’m not going to let the liars to win,"" the prime minister said. ""I’m going to manage and to lead this country, according to the laws.""

On Wednesday, Gantz announced that he had also failed to form a government.

Netanyahu still has the option to ask the Israeli Parliament for immunity. But this request would need to be approved by a special committee that has not been established due to ongoing political deadlock.

There are now 21 days in which any member of Parliament can become prime minister if they muster the 61 signatures needed to achieve a majority in the Knesset. If that does not happen, Israel will return to the polls.

If that happens, Netanyahu’s indictment potentially poses a new legal problem.

If he wins the next election, it will be the first time a candidate for government is under indictment, raising the question as to whether President Reuven Rivlin can give Netanyahu the mandate to form the next government.",1
886,Former Yakuza Boss Living in Cambodia Accused of Money Laundering,"The United States Treasury Department issued sanctions Wednesday against a former Japanese Yakuza boss believed to be living in Cambodia, accusing him of laundering money between Japan and the Kingdom.

“Tadamasa Goto possesses deep ties to the Yakuza and has been instrumental to its criminal operations around the world,” Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) Acting Director John E. Smith was quoted as saying in the treasury department statement. “Today’s action denies Goto access to the U.S. financial system and demonstrates our resolve to aggressively combat transnational criminal organizations and their supporters.”

The treasury department said they had frozen his assets in the United States and prohibited American citizens and residents from doing business with him.

Asked yesterday if Cambodian authorities were investigating Mr. Goto, Cambodia’s Interpol Director Lim Sokha Raksmey said that “he had no news about this.”

“Right now I don’t have any requests [to look into his case],” he said.

A former leader of a gang within the Yamaguchi-gumi crime syndicate, Mr. Goto was kicked out for alleged insubordination, and because of revelations that in 2001 he had supplied information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in return for a liver transplant at a Los Angeles hospital. After being voted out, he was exiled to Cambodia in October 2008, eventually training to become a Buddhist monk in 2009. In 2010 he published his auto-biography, announcing that the proceeds from sales would go towards several charitable causes, including the Angkor Association for the Disabled in Siem Reap (AAD).

AAD director Sem Sovantha told Khmer Times yesterday that Mr. Goto was still contributing funding to his organization and had so far given approximately $75,000, along with another $25,000 to another non-profit in the area. He said that he had not spoken with him recently. “During that time [2010] we had a big event to provide funding. We had the provincial governor and the four star generals,” he said. “Mr. Goto was there at the event.” The former provincial governor Sou Phirin could not be reached yesterday to confirm this. Although Mr. Goto has said that he no longer takes part in organized crime, the treasury department alleges that he has remained connected to Japan’s underworld.

“Tadamasa Goto reportedly still associates with numerous gang-tainted companies that he utilizes to facilitate his legitimate and illicit business activities,” the statement said. “He continues to support the Yamaguchi-gumi and remnants of his semi-defunct Goto-gumi by laundering their funds between Japan and Cambodia.”

In 2011, Goto agreed to pay a $1.4 million settlement to the family of real-estate developer Kazuoki Nozaki for a 2006 murder believed to have been carried out by his men. One of the suspects in the case, Takashi Kondo, was murdered in Thailand in April 2011.",1
751,US prosecutors: Lawyer laundered $400m in crypto scam,"A prosecutor told a jury that a lawyer on trial for laundering $400 millionin a massive cryptocurrency scam was motivated by a goal he once stated in a text message: “50 by 50,” or $50 million by age 50.

Mark Scott, 51, set up a phony investment fund that he used to process money from Ruja Ignatova, the Bulgarian woman behind OneCoin Ltd., a Ponzi scheme based on a fraudulent blockchain-based digital currency system, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Folly said in his closing argument Wednesday in Manhattan federal court. Folly claimed Scott was paid $50 million “just for laundering Ruja’s money.”

“This is what Scott desperately wanted and this is what motivated him to commit these crimes,” Folly said.

Prosecutors claim Scott, a former Locke Lord LLP partner, used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, buying a 57-foot yacht, multimillion-dollar homes in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and luxury watches and cars, including three Porsches.

“Mr. Scott did not know the OneCoin funds were illegal,” his lawyer, Arlo Devlin-Brown, told jurors. “None of it really matters unless they’ve proven the one thing that really matters in this case: What was inside Mark Scott’s head?”

The lawyer said that Scott believed he was operating a legitimate investment fund with money from Ignatova, who is to blame for the fraud. “This case is full of reasonable doubts,” he said.

Prosecutors claim Scott used a network of shell companies, offshore bank accounts and fraudulent documents to hide the origin of $400 million of illegal OneCoin proceeds. Scott is charged with money-laundering conspiracy and bank-fraud conspiracy. Before the start of both sides’ closing statements, Scott told the judge he wouldn’t be testifying in his own defense.

OneCoin generated 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2016, according to the government, but had no real value and couldn’t be used to buy anything.

At its height, OneCoin claimed to have more than three million members worldwide. It operated as a multilevel marketing network that paid commissions to members for recruiting others to buy OneCoin packages, prosecutors say. Jurors heard testimony from victims who had invested retirement and college savings and were left with nothing.

Also charged in the case are Ignatova, one of two people who founded OneCoin in 2014 in Sofia, Bulgaria, and her younger brother Konstantin Ignatov. Ignatova, known at OneCoin’s peak as the “cryptoqueen,” disappeared in 2017 as OneCoin came under suspicion. Ignatov was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March and is in custody.

The trial began with opening statements on Nov. 5. Jurors will begin deliberating Thursday morning.

The case is U.S. v. Scott, 17-cr-630, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).",1

446,Colombian drug lord's brother gets 30 years in U.S.,"By

2 Min Read

MIAMI (Reuters) - A U.S. court sentenced the brother of jailed Colombian drug lord Diego Montoya to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Norte del Valle cocaine cartel and was responsible for managing its finances, including maintaining cartel stash houses to store the cash proceeds of drug deals, prosecutors said.

Montoya Sanchez was arrested by Colombian authorities after a shootout in January 2007 and was extradited to Florida in June. He pleaded guilty in January in a federal court in Miami.

Montoya Sanchez told prosecutors the cartel kept up to $20 million in cash in stash houses around Colombia. He said he used drug proceeds to invest in real estate and outside businesses, as well as to fund cocaine labs and pay lab workers, cocaine transporters and security personnel.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.

Diego Montoya, who was extradited to Florida in December and is still awaiting trial, was a leading figure in Colombia’s underworld. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list.",1
824,Arrests made in Spanish bomb plot,"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish judge has charged 17 people in an alleged Islamic plot to blow up the court in Madrid that handles terrorism cases, according to a judge's order seen by CNN.

The truck bombing was aimed at killing judges, court personnel and civilians and destroying court files in cases against Islamic terrorists, the order says.

The alleged plot was directed by an Algerian man, Mohamed Acharf, who is under arrest in Switzerland. Spain has asked for his extradition.

According to the court order, Acharf assembled the group -- that called itself Martyrs for Morocco -- in Spanish prisons where he was serving time.

Spanish police arrested eight suspected Islamic radicals on Monday and Tuesday in connection with the plot, Spain's interior minister said.

Ten other suspects in the National Court plot already were in Spanish jails for other crimes. One man among the 18 is being held for further questioning and was not charged.

Judge Baltasar Garzon also issued arrest warrants for seven other people.

Arraignments in the case began Friday and were finished late Saturday before Garzon, a principal investigator of Islamic terrorism in Spain. All the charges were issued Saturday night.

The suspects allegedly would have packed at least 500 kilos (1,100 pounds) of explosives in a truck to blow up the court building on a busy street in central Madrid.

The police search this week of the homes of many suspects turned up no explosives, government officials said, but the court order said the conspirators had a clear plan to obtain explosives shortly before the attack on the court.

About 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of explosives were used in the bombs that hit the Madrid commuter rail network on March 11, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800.

The Madrid train bombings investigation is headed at the National Court by Judge Juan del Olmo.

Garzon last year indicted 35 people, including Osama bin Laden, for terrorism, including several people suspected of a role in the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.

The court order says the National Court bomb plot ""was not only under way but that, if it has been stopped, it is due to the police and judicial action that was deployed.""

The case against the suspects, the court order said, was built on the earlier testimony of a protected witness, documents seized -- including correspondence between various suspects making cryptic references to holy wars and martyrdom -- wiretapped conversations and police intelligence reports.

The 14-page court order links one suspect of the National Court bomb plot, Abdelkrim Bensmail, to a suspected ringleader of the Madrid train bombings and also to three men serving sentences in the United States for their roles in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York.

Bensmail was earlier convicted of belonging to the Armed Islamic Group, a terrorist group of Algerian origin, and while in Spanish prison, he received money from an Algerian, Allekema Lamari, through March 6, just five days before the March 11 Madrid train attacks, the court order said.

Police say Lamari was a suspected leader of the train bombings, and he was among the seven suspected terrorists -- all linked to the train bombings -- who blew themselves up on April 3 as police raided their suburban Madrid hideout, three weeks after the train bombings.

The court order said Bensmail and two other National Court plot suspects were all linked to three men -- Mohamed Salameh, Mahmud Abouhalima and Widal Ayyad -- who are serving terms in the United States for the 1993 World Trade Center attack in New York.

The suspects, under the direction of Acharf, formed the Martyrs for Morroco in late 2001 and early 2002, which police had determined by November 2003 was of a Salafist terrorist organization bent, aimed at carrying out a jihad, particularly in Spain, with an attack on the National Court and its staff.

The group members were willing to commit suicide attacks.

Members came together in Spanish prisons, particularly in Topas prison in Salamanca province west of Madrid, where many of the suspects were serving terms for common crimes.

Acharf made contact with men in the group who eventually were released from jail, in order to keep them ready to become part of a terrorist attack, the court order said.

Simultaneously, Acharf and others like him who had been earlier convicted for terrorist activities as part of the Armed Islamic Group, whose origins were in Algeria, carried out recruitment.

All but one of the 17 suspects were charged with belonging to an Islamic terrorist group.

The court order identified them as Abdelkrim Bensmail, Mohamed Amine Akli, Bachir Belhakem, Majid Mchmacha, Eddebdoubi Taoufik, of Morocco; Mouad Douas, Mustafa Farjani, of Morocco, Baanou Abdullah, of Morocco; Addila Mimon, of Algeria; Said Afif, Mokhatar Siah, Djamel Merabet, of Algeria;, Kamara Birahima Diadie, of Mauritania, Madjid Sahouane, Mourad Yala and Abdol Ghaffar Hashemi.

The 17th suspect, Baldomero Lara Sanchez, of Spain, was charged with collaborating with an Islamic terrorist group. The 18th suspect, Smail Latrech, was held over pending further investigation.",1

671,Canada announces Mulroney inquiry,"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced a public inquiry into corruption allegations involving former leader Brian Mulroney.

Police are also looking into the claims by German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber about a C$300,000 (£152,000) deal with Mr Mulroney.

Mr Schreiber said the lobbying deal was made before Mr Mulroney left office.

Mr Mulroney said it involved private business dealings after his departure from politics.

Mr Harper promised an investigation into the case last week, but announced the setting up of a formal inquiry on Tuesday.

Mr Mulroney, who served as Canada's Conservative prime minister from 1984 to 1993, has admitted receiving the money in cash in a series of hotel room meetings.

He called for a public inquiry on Monday, saying it was the only way to put the issue to rest.

'Total fabrication'

Previously, Mr Schreiber had said he made the payments after Mr Mulroney had stepped down, but in an affidavit last week, he said they were discussed before the prime minister left office.

Mr Schreiber, who is fighting extradition to Germany on tax and fraud allegations, is suing Mr Mulroney over the money.

He said Mr Mulroney failed to honour his side of the deal, which was to help him develop a chain of pasta restaurants and secure government approval for an arms factory in Quebec.

In the affidavit, Mr Schreiber also claimed that Mr Mulroney's former aide, Fred Doucet, had asked Mr Schreiber at some unspecified date to transfer funds to Mr Mulroney's lawyer in Geneva ""related to the Airbus deal"".

Mr Doucet told the Globe and Mail newspaper that he had ""never spoken to Karlheinz Schreiber about transferring any funds, anywhere"", adding that the allegation was ""an absolute, total fabrication"".",1
851,HSBC pays record $1.9bn fine to settle US money-laundering accusations,"HSBC was guilty of a ""blatant failure"" to implement anti-money laundering controls and wilfully flouted US sanctions, American prosecutors said, as the bank was forced to pay a record $1.9bn (£1.2bn) to settle allegations it allowed terrorists to move money around the financial system.

Hours after the bank's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said he was ""profoundly sorry"" for the failures, assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer told a press conference in New York that Mexican drug traffickers deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. At least $881m in drug trafficking money was laundered throughout the bank's accounts.

""HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight – and worse,"" said Breuer, ""that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries.""

In Mexico the bank ""severely understaffed"" its compliance department and failed to implement an anti-money laundering programme despite evidence of serious risks. A complex scheme known as the black market peso exchange (BMPE) was used to launder the cash.

Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance said: ""New York is the centre of international finance and those who use our banks as a vehicle for international crime will not be tolerated.""

In the latest embarrassment for Britain's banks, Gulliver said: ""We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again,"" he said, insisting Britain's biggest bank was ""a fundamentally different organisation"" now. It is the largest ever fine for such an offence and even greater than the £940m the bank had feared it faced after the allegations first surfaced in the summer in a report by the US Senate.

The fine for HSBC comes barely 24 hours after Standard Chartered paid £415m to US regulators, and as banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS brace for a wave of fines in coming days for attempting to rig Libor following the £290m penalty slapped on Barclays in June.

Gulliver was promoted to chief executive two years ago during a management reshuffle caused by the decision by Lord Green, the chairman, to quit to join the government as a trade minister.

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which Green represents, said: ""The report by the US Senate sub-committee sets out in detail the evidence submitted to it and the action taken by HSBC to ensure compliance with US regulations at the time that Lord Green was group chairman. At the time of the report's publication HSBC expressed its regret that there were failures of implementation and Lord Green has said that he shares that regret.""

David Bagley, the bank's head of compliance, dramatically quit before the US Senate committee hearing into the case in July and, on Monday, HSBC named a former US official, Bob Werner, as head of group financial crime compliance, a newly created role, as the bank prepared for the fine related to drug allegations.

The penalty includes a five-year agreement with the US department of justice under which the bank will install an independent monitor to assess reformed internal controls. The bank's top executives will defer part of their bonuses for the whole of the five-year period, while bonuses have been clawed back from a number of former and current executives, including those in the US directly involved at the time.

HSBC has managed to avoid being criminally prosecuted – a move that could have stopped the bank operating in the US.

HSBC's share price rose by 2.8p to 644p despite the size of the fine. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the fine was slightly lower than the $2bn he had been pencilling in to his forecasts. But he said: ""HSBC's settlement with the US authorities will include a deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice of five years' duration. Given HSBC's ongoing US business and other continuing conduct investigations, this sword of Damocles is not without teeth, albeit based on what we know, we are regarding the $1.921bn settlement as de facto 'final'.""

Gulliver stressed that the bank had co-operated with the US authorities. ""Over the last two years, under new senior leadership, we have been taking concrete steps to put right what went wrong and to participate actively with government authorities in bringing to light and addressing these matters,"" he said.

""We are committed to protecting the integrity of the global financial system. To this end we will continue to work closely with governments and regulators around the world,"" he added.

The US Senate said the bank had operated a ""pervasively polluted"" culture that lasted for years, allowing HSBC to move billions around the financial system for Mexican drug lords, terrorists and governments on sanctions lists. HSBC's Mexican operations moved $7bn into the US operations, for instance, which the Senate was told was tied to drug money.

HSBC said it also expected to finalise an ""undertaking"" with the UK regulator, the Financial Services Authority, ""shortly"".

The bank has spent $290m on improving its systems to try to avoid a re-run of the events.",1
844,Sam Sodje: Ex-Reading footballer accused of money laundering,"A former Premier League footballer laundered more than £30,000 linked to an international fraud, a court has heard.

Sam Sodje, 39, is alleged to have funnelled the cash through his own bank account after companies were tricked into handing over money.

The former Reading player is standing trial at the Old Bailey accused of four money laundering offences said to have been committed in November 2013.

He denies all of the charges.

Companies in Colombia, India and Italy were fooled into handing over money by fraudsters who sent emails posing as the firms' suppliers, the court was told.

Former Nigeria international Mr Sodje, who also played for clubs including Charlton Athletic, Brentford and Leeds United during his career, is alleged to have laundered proceeds from that scam.

The jury heard the funds were paid into an account in London belonging to Mr Sodje's 38-year-old brother Akpo Sodje.

Akpo Sodje, also a former professional footballer, is believed to be in Dubai and has ""declined"" to return to the country to be quizzed about the alleged offences, the court heard.

Julian Christopher QC, prosecuting, said there was no evidence the brothers were involved in the fraud itself.

He said: ""The prosecution allegation against Sam Sodje is that he was involved, not in the trickery in the beginning itself, but in the onward transfer of the proceeds of the fraud through his own bank account, then out again as cash or bank transfers.

""So, when the money reached its ultimate destination, wherever that may be, minus a fee it would be laundered free of the link to any frauds by which it was obtained.""

Mr Sodje, from Dartford, Kent, denies two counts of acquiring criminal property, converting criminal property and transferring criminal property.",1

The central bank said it took action over some foreign exchange trades Absa Bank carried out in March, and said Absa also failed to satisfactorily make “know your customer checks” in the trades.

“Absa Kenya is required to ... reverse the market positions that were created as a result of the flagged transactions,” the central bank said in a statement. (Reporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Jon Boyle)",1
288,"Walsall trio who raised £10,000 for British Isis fighter in Syria convicted of funding terrorism","Three men who raised money for a British Isis fighter in Syria by selling items on eBay have been convicted of funding terrorism.

The trio raised a total of £10,000 for Musadiqur Rohaman and his wife Zohura Siddeka, who left Walsall to join the so-called Islamic State in Raqqa in 2014.

His two brothers, Mohammed Iqbal Hussain, 26, and Mohammed Suyaubur Rohaman, 32, and family friend Mohammed Khan, 27, denied the charges and claimed the money was to help the couple return to the UK.

They were convicted of funding terrorism between November 2014 and June 2015 at the conclusion of trial at the Old Bailey on Friday.

The court heard that Rohaman left for Syria after claiming he was going on holiday but that his brothers knew the real reason for his journey and kept in regular contact.

While working at the family launderette in Caldmore, they raised cash and sent it to the couple via Western Union Bank transfers made at a shop next to their business.

Iqbal and Suyaubur sold their brother's £4,000 BMW, his wife's wedding dress and £1,200 worth of family gold to raise a total of £10,000, despite their mother’s attempts to lock up valuables in the family home.

They also arranged for Siddeka's maternity pay from her job as a teacher to be sent out to Syria. She gave birth before they left in September 2014 but the baby died days later.

The court heard that Iqbal also recruited Khan to take out credit loans in Rohaman’s name and attempt to sell pieces of family gold.

After arriving in the so-called Islamic State Rohaman maintained contact with his family in the UK through a variety of secure internet messaging platforms and Skype, with some of the messages proving he was engaged in fighting.

The couple had travelled to Syria via Turkey with another Walsall man, Abul Hasan, who is since believed to have been killed while fighting with Isis.

Nigel Lambert QC, representing Hussain, described the case as a “family tragedy” in court, adding: “Their brother remains in Syria. This was a matter of misguided loyalty.""

Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale, from West Midlands Police, said investigations showed Iqbal and Suyaubur knew their brother was fighting in Syria.

“It is believed Musadiqur directed his brothers in what he needed doing and sent them names of who to transfer money to,” he added.

“Disruption of terrorist funding is an important part of our investigations. Sending money to those actively engaged in terrorism helps fund their activities and we will continue to act on any intelligence and disrupt the flow of money to conflict zones.”

Iqbal, a qualified lawyer and aspiring solicitor, was found guilty of receiving money for the purposes of terrorism and entering into a funding arrangement.

Khan was convicted of entering into a funding arrangement and Suyaubur was convicted of providing money for the purposes of terrorism. They will be sentenced on 9 September.

A fourth man Maruf Uddin, 26, also from Walsall, was cleared of entering into a funding arrangement.",1

Bozize was listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 36 of Resolution 2134 (2014) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of CAR’.

Additional information

In liaison with his supporters, Bozize encouraged the attack of 5 December 2013 on Bangui. Since then, he has continued trying to run destabilization operations in order to maintain tensions in the capital of CAR. Bozize reportedly created the anti-Balaka militia group before he fled the CAR on March 24, 2013. In a communique, Bozize called on his militia to pursue the atrocities against the current regime and the Islamists. Bozize reportedly provided financial and material support to militiamen who are working to destabilize the ongoing transition and to bring Bozize back to power. The bulk of the anti-Balaka are from the Central African Armed Forces who dispersed into the countryside after the coup d'état and were subsequently reorganized by Bozize. Bozize and his supporters control more than half the anti-Balaka units.

Forces loyal to Bozize were armed with assault rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers and they have become increasingly involved in reprisal attacks against CAR's Muslim population. The situation in CAR deteriorated rapidly after the December 5, 2013 attack in Bangui by anti-Balaka forces that left over 700 people dead.

Information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:

Nourredine was listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 36 of Resolution 2134 (2014) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of CAR’.

Additional information

Noureddine is one of the original leaders of the Seleka. He has been identified as both a General and the President of one of the armed rebel groups of the Seleka, the Central PJCC, a group formally known as the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace and whose acronym is also acknowledged as CPJP. As former head of the ‘Fundamental’ splinter group of the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP/F), he was the military coordinator of the ex-Séléka during offensives in the former rebellion in the Central African Republic between early December 2012 and March 2013. Without Noureddine's assistance and close relationship with Chadian Special Forces, the Seleka would likely have been unable to wrest power from former CAR President Francois Bozize.

Since the appointment as interim president of Catherine Samba-Panza on 20 January 2014, he was one of the main architects of the ex-Séléka's tactical withdrawal in Sibut with the aim of implementing his plan to create a Muslim stronghold in the north of the country. He had clearly urged his forces to resist the injunctions of the transitional government and of the military leaders of the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA). Noureddine actively directs ex-Seleka, the former Seleka forces that were reportedly dissolved by Djotodia in September 2013, and directs operations against Christian neighborhoods and continues to provide significant support and direction to the ex-Seleka operating in CAR.

Nourredine was also listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 37(b) of Resolution 2134 (2014) as ‘involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable’.

After the Séléka took control of Bangui on 24 March 2013, Nourredine Adam was appointed Minister for Security, then Director General of the ‘Extraordinary Committee for the Defence of Democratic Achievements’ (Comité extraordinaire de défense des acquis démocratiques- CEDAD, a now-defunct CAR intelligence service). Nourredine Adam used the CEDAD as his personal political police, carrying out many arbitrary arrests, acts of torture and summary executions. In addition, Noureddine was one of the key figures behind the bloody operation in Boy Rabe. In August 2013, Seleka forces stormed Boy Rabe, a CAR neighborhood regarded as a bastion of Francois Bozize supporters and his ethnic group. Under the pretext of looking for arms caches, Seleka troops reportedly killed scores of civilians and went on a rampage of looting. When these raids spread to other quarters, thousands of residents invaded the international airport, which was perceived as a safe place because of the presence of French troops, and occupied its runway.

Nourredine was also listed on 9 May 2014 pursuant to paragraph 37(d) of Resolution 2134 (2014) as ‘providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through illegal exploitation of natural resources’.

In early 2013, Nourredine Adam played an important role in the ex-Séléka's financing networks. He travelled to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to collect funds for the former rebellion. He also operated as a facilitator for a Chadian diamond-trafficking ring operating between the Central African Republic and Chad.

He is also a leader of the so-called ‘Defense Committee’ of Bangui's PK5 (known as ‘PK5 Resistance’ or ‘Texas’) (not listed), which extorts money from residents and threatens and employs physical violence. Gaye was appointed on 2 November 2014 by Nourredine Adam (CFi.002) as rapporteur of the political coordination of the FPRC. On 9 May 2014, the Security Council Committee established by Resolution 2127 (2013) on CAR included Adam on its sanctions list. Photo available for inclusion in the INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link: https://www.interpol.int/en/notice/search/un/5915753

Information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:

Haroun Gaye was listed on 17 December 2015 pursuant to paragraphs 11 and 12(b) and (f) of Resolution 2196 (2015) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR’; ‘involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable, or that constitute human rights abuses or violations, in the CAR, including acts involving sexual violence, targeting of civilians, ethnic- or religious-based attacks, attacks on schools and hospitals, and abduction and forced displacement’; and ‘involved in planning, directing, sponsoring, or conducting attacks against UN missions or international security presences, including Minusca, the European Union missions and French operations which support them’.

Additional information:

Haroun Gaye has been, since early 2014, one of the leaders of an armed group operating in the PK5 neighbourhood in Bangui. Civil Society representatives of the PK5 neighbourhood state that Gaye and his armed group are fuelling the conflict in Bangui, opposing the reconciliation and preventing movements of population to and from the third district of Bangui. On 11 May 2015, Gaye and 300 demonstrators blocked access to the National Transitional Council to disrupt the final day of the Bangui Forum. Gaye is reported to have collaborated with anti-Balaka officials to coordinate the disruption.

On 26 June 2015, Gaye and a small entourage disrupted the opening of a voter registration drive in Bangui's PK5 neighbourhood, causing the registration drive to close.

Minusca attempted to arrest Gaye on 2 August 2015, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 32(f)(i) of the Security Council Resolution 2217 (2015). Gaye, who was reportedly informed of the arrest attempt in advance, was ready with supporters armed with heavy weaponry. Gaye's forces opened fire on the Minusca Joint Task Force. In a seven-hour firefight, Gaye's men employed firearms, and rocket-propelled and hand grenades against Minusca troops and killed one peacekeeper and injured eight. Gaye was involved in encouraging violent protests and clashes in late September 2015 in what appears to have been a coup attempt to overthrow the Transitional Government. The coup attempt was likely led by former president Bozize's supporters in an alliance of convenience with Gaye and other FPRC leaders. It appears that Gaye aimed to create a cycle of retaliatory attacks that would threaten the upcoming elections. Gaye was in charge of coordination with marginalised elements of the anti-Balaka.

On 1 October 2015, a meeting took place in the PK5 neighbourhood between Eugène Barret Ngaïkosset, a member of a marginalised anti-Balaka group and Gaye, with the aim of planning a joint attack on Bangui on Saturday 3 October. Gaye's group prevented people inside the PK5 neighbourhood from leaving it, in order to reinforce the communal identity of the Muslim population to exacerbate inter-ethnic tensions and avoid reconciliation. On 26 October 2015, Gaye and his group interrupted a meeting between the Archbishop of Bangui and the Imam of the Central Mosque of Bangui, and threatened the delegation which had to retreat from the Central Mosque and flee the PK5 neighbourhood.

Address: (a) Bangui, Central African Republic.

Date of UN designation: 17 December 2015.

Other information:

Captain Eugène Barret Ngaïkosset is a former member of former President François Bozizé's presidential guard and associated with the anti-Balaka movement. He escaped from jail on 17 May 2015 following his extradition from Brazzaville and created his own anti-Balaka faction including former FACA fighters.

Information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:

Eugène Barret Ngaïkosset was listed on 17 December 2015 pursuant to paragraphs 11 and 12(b) and (f) of Resolution 2196 (2015) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR’; ‘involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable, or that constitute human rights abuses or violations, in the CAR, including acts involving sexual violence, targeting of civilians, ethnic- or religious-based attacks, attacks on schools and hospitals, and abduction and forced displacement’; and ‘involved in planning, directing, sponsoring, or conducting attacks against UN missions or international security presences, including Minusca, the European Union missions and French operations which support them’.

Additional information:

Ngaïkosset is one of the main perpetrators of the violence which erupted in Bangui in late September 2015. Ngaïkosset and other anti-Balaka worked together with marginalised members of ex-Séléka in an effort to destabilise the CAR Transitional Government. On the night of 27-28 September 2015, Ngaïkosset and others made an unsuccessful attempt to storm the ‘Izamo’ gendarmerie camp in order to steal weapons and ammunition. On 28 September, the group surrounded the offices of CAR national radio.

On 1 October 2015, a meeting took place in the PK5 neighbourhood between Ngaïkosset and Haroun Gaye, a leader of the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de Centrafrique (FPRC), with the aim of planning a joint attack on Bangui on Saturday 3 October.

On 8 October, 2015, the CAR Justice Minister announced plans to investigate Ngaïkosset and other individuals for their roles in the September 2015 violence in Bangui. Ngaikosset and the others were named as being involved in ‘egregious behaviour constituting a breach of the internal security of the state, conspiracy, incitement to civil war, civil disobedience, hatred and complicity’. CAR legal authorities were instructed to open an investigation to search for and arrest the perpetrators and accomplices.

On 11 October 2015, Ngaïkosset is believed to have asked anti-Balaka militia under his command to carry out kidnappings, with a particular focus on French nationals, but also CAR political figures and UN officials, with the aim of forcing the departure of the transitional President, Catherine Samba-Panza.

Father's name is Luizi Obol. Mother's name is Nora Obol. INTERPOL-UN Security Council Special Notice web link: https://www.interpol.int/en/notice/search/un/5932340

Information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:

Joseph Kony was listed on 7 March 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 (b), (c), and (d) of Resolution 2262 (2016) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR’; ‘involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable, or that constitute human rights abuses or violations, in the CAR, including acts involving sexual violence, targeting of civilians, ethnic- or religious-based attacks, attacks on schools and hospitals, and abduction and forced displacement’; ‘recruiting or using children in armed conflict in the CAR, in violation of applicable international law’; and ‘providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through the illicit exploitation or trade of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, and wildlife products in or from the CAR’.

Additional information:

Kony founded the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and has been described as the group's founder, religious leader, chairman, and commander-in-chief. Emerging in northern Uganda in the 1980s, the LRA engaged in the abduction, killing, and mutilation of thousands of civilians across central Africa. Under increasing military pressure, Kony ordered the LRA to withdraw from Uganda in 2005 and 2006. Since then, the LRA has been operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), CAR, South Sudan and reportedly Sudan.

Kony, as the leader of the LRA, devises and implements LRA strategy, including standing orders to attack and brutalize civilian populations. Since December 2013, the LRA under the leadership of Joseph Kony has kidnapped, displaced, committed sexual violence against, and killed hundreds of individuals across CAR, and has looted and destroyed civilian property. Concentrated in eastern CAR and reportedly in Kafia Kingi, a territory on the border of Sudan and South Sudan whose final status has yet to be determined but militarily controlled by the former, the LRA raids villages to pillage food and supplies. The fighters set ambushes to attack security forces and steal their equipment when they respond to LRA attacks, and LRA fighters also target and loot villages that do not have a military presence. The LRA has also intensified attacks on diamond and gold mining sites.

Kony is subject to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. The ICC has charged him with twelve counts of crimes against humanity including murder, enslavement, sexual enslavement, rape, inhumane acts of inflicting serious bodily injury and suffering, and twenty-one counts of war crimes including murder, cruel treatment of civilians, intentionally directing an attack against a civilian population, pillaging, inducing rape, and enlisting, through abduction, of children under the age of 15 years.

Kony has issued standing orders for rebel fighters to loot diamonds and gold from artisanal miners in eastern Central African Republic. Reportedly, some of the minerals are then transported by Kony's group to Sudan, or traded with local civilians and members of the former Séléka.

Kony has also instructed his fighters to poach elephants in the Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from where elephant tusks are reportedly transported through the east of the Central African Republic to Sudan, where senior LRA officials reportedly sell and trade with Sudanese merchants and local officials. The trade of ivory represents a significant source of income for Kony's group. As of January 2015, 500 Lord's Resistance Army elements were reportedly expelled from the Sudan.

Information from the narrative summary of reasons for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:

Ali Kony was listed on 23 August 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 (d) and (g) of Resolution 2262 (2016) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR’; ‘providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through the illicit exploitation or trade of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, wildlife as well as wildlife products in or from the CAR’; ‘Being leaders of an entity that the Committee has designated pursuant to paragraphs 36 or 37 of Resolution 2134 (2014) or Resolution 2262 (2016)or having provided support to, or acted for or on behalf of, or at the direction of, an individual or an entity that the Committee has designated pursuant to paragraphs 36 or 37 of Resolution 2134 (2014) or Resolution 2262 (2016), or an entity owned or controlled by a designated individual or entity’.

Ali Kony is seen as a potential successor to Joseph Kony as leader of the LRA. Ali is increasingly involved in LRA operational planning and is seen as a gateway to Joseph Kony. Ali is also an LRA intelligence officer with command of up to 10 subordinates.

Ali and his brother Salim Kony have both been responsible for enforcing discipline within the LRA. Both brothers are acknowledged to be part of Joseph Kony's leadership inner-circle, responsible for the execution of Kony's orders. The two have made disciplinary decisions to punish or kill LRA members who have disobeyed LRA rules. Based on orders from Joseph Kony, Salim and Ali are involved in trafficking ivory from northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s Garamba National Park through the Central African Republic (CAR) to the disputed region of Kafia Kingi for sale or trade with local merchants.

Ali Kony is responsible for negotiating ivory prices and bartering the ivory with the merchants. Ali meets once or twice a month with merchants to negotiate the price of the LRA's ivory in U.S. dollars or Sudanese pounds, or to trade for weapons, ammunition, and food. Joseph Kony has ordered Ali to use the largest tusks to purchase anti-personnel mines to surround Kony's camp. In July 2014, Ali Kony oversaw the operation to move 52 pieces of ivory for delivery to Joseph Kony and ultimate sale.

In April 2015, Salim departed Kafia Kingi to retrieve a shipment of tusks. In May, Salim participated in the transport of 20 pieces of ivory from DRC to Kafia Kingi. Around the same time, Ali met with the merchants to purchase supplies and to plan a future meeting to conduct additional transactions and to agree to terms of purchase on the LRA's behalf for what is assessed to be the ivory that Salim was escorting.

Salim Kony was listed on 23 August 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 (d) and (g) of Resolution 2262 (2016) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR’; ‘providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through the illicit exploitation or trade of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, wildlife as well as wildlife products in or from the CAR’; ‘Being leaders of an entity that the Committee has designated pursuant to paragraphs 36 or 37 of Resolution 2134 (2014) or Resolution 2262 (2016), or having provided support to, or acted for or on behalf of, or at the direction of, an individual or an entity that the Committee has designated pursuant to paragraphs 36 or 37 of Resolution 2134 (2014) or Resolution 2262 (2016), or an entity owned or controlled by a designated individual or entity’.

Salim Kony is the head commander of the LRA's ‘field headquarters’ and has jointly planned LRA attacks and defensive measures with Joseph Kony since an early age. Previously, Salim led the group which provides security for Joseph Kony. More recently, Joseph Kony has entrusted Salim with managing the LRA's financial and logistical networks.

Salim and his brother Ali Kony have both been responsible for enforcing discipline within the LRA. Both brothers are acknowledged as members of Joseph Kony's leadership inner-circle, who are responsible for executing Joseph Kony's orders. The two have made disciplinary decisions to punish or kill LRA members who have disobeyed LRA rules. Salim is reported to have killed LRA members who intended to defect, and has reported LRA group and member activities to Joseph Kony.

Based on orders from Joseph Kony, Salim and Ali are involved with the trafficking of ivory from northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s Garamba National Park through the Central African Republic (CAR) to the disputed region of Kafia Kingi for sale or trade with local merchants.

Salim often deploys to the CAR border with approximately a dozen fighters to meet and escort other LRA groups carrying ivory north from Garamba. In April 2015, Salim departed Kafia Kingi to retrieve a shipment of tusks. In May, Salim participated in the transport of twenty pieces of ivory from DRC to Kafia Kingi.

Previously, in June 2014, Salim crossed into the DRC with a group of LRA fighters to poach elephants in Garamba. Joseph Kony had also tasked Salim with escorting two LRA commanders to Garamba to uncover caches of ivory that had been hidden there years earlier. In July 2014, Salim met with a second LRA group to transport the ivory, 52 pieces in all, to Kafia Kingi. Salim was responsible for maintaining ivory accountability to Joseph Kony and for passing information about ivory transactions to LRA groups.

The Bureau d'Achat de Diamant en Centrafrique (BADICA) continued in 2014 to purchase diamonds from Bria and Sam-Ouandja (Haute Kotto province) in the east of the Central African Republic, where former Séléka forces impose taxes on aircraft transporting diamonds and receive security payments from diamond collectors. Several of BADICA's supplying collectors in Bria and Sam-Ouandja are closely associated with former Séléka commanders.

In May 2014, Belgian authorities seized two diamond parcels sent to BADICA's representation in Antwerp, which is officially registered in Belgium as KARDIAM. Diamond experts assessed that the diamonds seized have a high probability to be of Central African origin, and that they display characteristics typical of Sam-Ouandja and Bria, as well as Nola (Sangha Mbaéré province), in the south west of the country.

Traders who were purchasing diamonds illegally trafficked from Central African Republic to foreign markets, including from the western part of the country, have operated in Cameroon on behalf of BADICA.

In May 2014, BADICA also exported gold produced in Yaloké (Ombella-Mpoko), where artisanal gold mines fell under control of Séléka until the beginning of February 2014, when anti-Balakagroups took over.

The Lord's Resistance Army was listed on 7 March 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 12 and 13 (b), (c), and (d) of Resolution 2262 (2016) as ‘engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR;’, ‘involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable, or that constitute human rights abuses or violations, in the CAR, including acts involving sexual violence, targeting of civilians, ethnic- or religious-based attacks, attacks on schools and hospitals, and abduction and forced displacement;’, ‘recruiting or using children in armed conflict in the CAR, in violation of applicable international law;’ and ‘providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through the illicit exploitation or trade of natural resources, including diamonds, gold, and wildlife products in or from the CAR’.

Additional information:

Emerging in northern Uganda in the 1980s, the LRA has engaged in the abduction, killing, and mutilation of thousands of civilians across central Africa. Under increasing military pressure, Joseph Kony, the LRA's leader, ordered the LRA to withdraw from Uganda in 2005 and 2006. Since then, the LRA has been operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), CAR, South Sudan and reportedly Sudan.

Since December 2013, the LRA has kidnapped, displaced, committed sexual violence against, and killed hundreds of individuals across CAR, and has looted and destroyed civilian property. Concentrated in eastern CAR and reportedly in Kafia Kingi, a territory on the border of Sudan and South Sudan whose final status has yet to be determined but militarily controlled by the former, the LRA raids villages to pillage food and supplies. The fighters set ambushes to attack security forces and steal their equipment when they respond to LRA attacks, and LRA fighters also target and loot villages that do not have a military presence. The LRA has also intensified attacks on diamond and gold mining sites.

LRA cells are frequently accompanied by captives who are forced to work as porters, cooks, and sex slaves. The LRA engages in gender-based violence including rapes of women and young girls.

In December 2013, the LRA abducted dozens of people in Haute-Kotto. The LRA is reported to have been involved in the abductions of hundreds of civilians in CAR since the beginning of 2014.

LRA fighters attacked Obo, in eastern CAR's Haut-Mbomou Prefecture, on several occasions in early 2014.

The LRA continued to carry out attacks in Obo and other locations in southeastern CAR between May and July 2014, including apparently coordinated attacks and abductions in Mbomou Prefecture in early June.

Since at least 2014, the LRA has been involved in elephant poaching and elephant trafficking for revenue generation. The LRA reportedly traffics ivory from Garamba National Park in northern DRC to Darfur, to trade for weapons and supplies. The LRA reportedly transports poached elephant tusks through CAR into Darfur, Sudan to sell. Additionally, as of early 2014, Kony had reportedly ordered LRA fighters to loot diamonds and gold from miners in eastern CAR for transport to Sudan. As of January 2015, 500 Lord's Resistance Army elements were reportedly expelled from the Sudan.

In early February 2015, LRA fighters armed with heavy weapons abducted civilians in Kpangbayanga, Haut-Mbomou, and stole food items.

On April 20, 2015, an LRA attack and the abduction of children from Ndambissoua, southeastern CAR led most of the village residents to flee. And in early July 2015, the LRA attacked several villages in southern Haute-Kotto Prefecture; the attacks involved looting, violence against civilians, burning of houses, and kidnapping.

Since January 2016, attacks imputed to the LRA have multiplied in Mbomou, Haut-Mbomou and Haute-Kotto affecting in particular mining areas in Haute-Kotto. These attacks have involved looting, violence against civilians, destruction of property and abductions. They have led to displacements of the population, including around 700 people who have sought refuge in Bria.’",1
577,Two Chinese Nationals Charged With Laundering $100M in Stolen Cryptocurrency,"Two Chinese nationals have been charged by U.S. prosecutors with laundering more than $100 million worth of cryptocurrency that had been stolen by North Korean hackers in 2018.

Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong face charges of money laundering, conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.

U.S. authorities say North Korean hackers stole nearly $250 million from a virtual currency exchange in 2018 before laundering the money through hundreds of transactions in order to make the theft difficult to trace. The hackers are allegedly behind the theft of about $50 million from a South Korean virtual currency exchange in 2019.

In addition to bringing criminal charges against Yinyin and Jiadong, prosecutors filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington to seize control of 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses that had been used by the duo and other co-conspirators.

""Today's actions underscore that the [Justice] Department will pierce the veil of anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are located,"" assistant attorney general Brian A. Benczkowski said in a statement.

Yinyin and Jiadong operated virtual currency transmission services but conducted business in the United States without a permit from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.",1
864,Mnangagwa forced himself on Augustine Chihuri’s pregnant wife,"Former police boss Augustine Chihuri has accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa of hounding him to settle scores after they clashed over a woman.

Chihuri, who is on the verge of losing his sprawling business empire and properties to the state after allegations that he amassed the wealth through corrupt means, made the startling allegations in an affidavit filed at the High Court on Friday.

The ex-police commissioner-general wants the court to set aside the unexplained wealth order it issued against him on June 20.

Chihuri said he was being persecuted because of his strained relationship with Mnangagwa dating back to the liberation struggle where the president allegedly snatched his then pregnant wife.

Justice Felistas Chatukuta granted an application by prosecutor-general Kumbirai Hodzi for an order forcing Chihuri and his wife, Isobel Halima Khan, to explain how they acquired their properties as part of a process to seize them.

Chihuri is accused of pilfering US$32 million in public funds that he used to buy a large swathe of properties.

The long-serving ex-top cop, however, said the allegation was part of a victimisation crusade by Mnangagwa that intensified after the 2017 coup.

He narrated how Mnangagwa allegedly snatched his then wife before vowing to make his life “hell” as long as he lived.

Chihuri said his problems started when he got married the “Zanu way” in Chimoio in Mozambique before the then political commissar, Mayor Urimbo (late), around 1976 and the following year, his wife became pregnant.

“The current president of Zimbabwe, Mr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, was aware of this union and pregnancy. Using his position, my then wife was transferred to Shai Shai in Mozambique where Mr Mnangagwa had a forced affair with her as she alleged,” he wrote in the affidavit.

“I tried to terminate the marriage, but the political commissar threatened me not to dare to do it, citing that Mr Mnangagwa [as he then was]is a dangerous man and would behead me as he was not hesitant to kill.”

Chihuri said Urimbo told him: “Do not gamble with your life, dear comrade.”

“From then my relationship with the president of Zimbabwe worsened. He went on to suggest that my then wife terminate the pregnancy,” he said.

“God was on my side, it was tried and it failed.

“The late Cde Serbia, who was working under Mr Mnangagwa in the security department, told me about the termination of the pregnancy and that Mr Mnangagwa vowed that as long as he lived, I shall pay for not giving up on my then wife to him.

“Cde Serbia warned me again to keep quiet or else I would perish and never see the light of day.”

Chihuri said the dispute between the two has since been turned into a “national spectacle for the purpose of victimisation.”

“One can clearly see how the public media in the country has been reporting about me and my family, wife and children that we have been targeted for annihilation,” he said.

Chihuri said the November 2017 coup saw the intensification of the onslaught by Mnangagwa after he refused to turn against the late president Robert Mugabe and join the coup plotters. He was forced to retire a month after the coup.

He alleged that in December 2017, his successor Godwin Matanga instructed a police constable to shoot him and burn his Greystone Park house.
“My family home was burnt beyond recognition,” he said.

“The fire was started in my home office burning all files, records, 15 Bibles, etc were destroyed.

“To make sure that the records and files were destroyed, he took a 20-litre diesel container and another container with oil.

“He sprayed both in the office, the main bedroom as the major target and so he did the rest of the house except the guest wing.

“Maukazuva [the constable]is facing serious criminal charges, two attempted murder charges and one of arson and malicious injury to property.”

Chihuri accuses Matanga of doing Mnangagwa’s bidding by pursuing criminal cases against him.

Chihuri alleged Matanga systematically engaged in a strategy of harassing his family, relatives and workers, threatening and beating his workers at gunpoint.

“The harassment was made worse when my young children would be threatened by police with guns to produce their father and said that they had been sent by Matanga,” he claimed.

“My children are suffering emotional trauma and they started having nightmares, refusing to go to school as unmarked vehicles would be following them going to and coming back from school.”

Chihuri alleged Matanga was using “all tactics” to persecute him as a result of his “incompetence, which is due to lack of education”.

He claimed the police boss does not have O’Level qualifications.

“He is doing all that he can in order to secure his post,” Chihuri claimed.

“He realises that as a mere ZIPAM diploma holder on behest of ZRP (sic), having been promoted to the post of the country’s police chief is a vulnerable position because his deputies are more educated than him, with Masters and even PhD degrees,” Chihuri said.

“He does not even hold an O’ Level certificate, which is a basic requirement for a constable to join the police.

“It goes on to show that he was rewarded for being a willing participant in the coup process and not on merit.”

Chihuri said Matanga lied to then Zimbabwe Defence Forces commander and now Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga that he (Chihuri) wanted to arrest him upon his return from China at Robert Mugabe International Airport just before the coup.

“This was not so, but a blatant lie to sow the seeds of division and hate between me and the then CDF. Godwin Matanga did all this to secure his position,” he said.

At the time of the coup it was alleged that attempts to arrest Chiwenga forced the military to move against Mugabe.

Chihuri said what surprises him was that all allegations against him were to do with the administration department, which Matanga used to head.

“By way of emphasis, I bring it to the attention of this honourable court that a lot of senior officers across the rank and file and my then deputies, including Godwin Matanga and his wife, supplied a wide range of vegetables and meat to ZRP amenities,” he said.

“These officers supplied large quantities of beef, chicken, vegetables, fruits and goods according to their ability as a general practice in support of indigenisation.

“The former SAC (Senior Assistant Commissioner) Charles Makono and his wife Abigail Makono, owners of Rewstand Pvt Ltd, also supplied uniform fabrics for over $10 million to ZRP ordinance.

“This company was also chosen by Godwin Matanga as many others he chose out of the 200 companies that were cleared by the procurement board to supply ZRP.”
He said the ZRP Retention Fund was not a creation of the police, but government.

As for the source of his wealth, Chihuri said besides salaries, bonus, conditions of service and savings from foreign trips over a period of 37 years, he was also a delegate and vice-president for Africa in Interpol.

“I was remunerated in foreign currency for serving in those organisations for six years,” he said, adding that he built his empire through “hard work and diligence.”

Chihuri skipped the country after he was fired and remains in self-imposed exile.-Thestandard",1
678,Fridley Man Scams Thousands In Fraudulent Telemarketing Scheme,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — A Fridley man has been charged with scamming thousands of people out of more than $10 million by mail and wire fraud.

Wayne Robert Dahl, 50, faces four counts of mail fraud and four counts of wire fraud after using tactics to sell fake magazine packages to more than 13,000 people across the United States.

According to the complaint, Dahl owned “Your Magazine Service, Inc.,” which was a fraudulent telemarketing company operated out of Chaska. The company tricked its “customers” — mostly elderly — into signing up for magazine subscriptions they did not want nor realize they were purchasing. During the calls, Dahl would direct his employees to get the customers to disclose their credit card information and would then bill them 20 monthly payments of $49.90 for the magazine packages.

Dahl will make his first court appearance in a U.S. District Court at a later date.",1
663,"GOP Welcomes Steve Wynn's Millions, Despite Rape And Harassment Allegations","A major political donor, who just two years ago was forced out of his position as Finance Chair of the Republican National Committee, has contributed millions of dollars this election cycle to Republican candidates and political action committees aligned with the party.

Steve Wynn's political contributions were once seen as toxic. A series of investigative reports in the Wall Street Journal detailed alleged rape, assault and harassment by the now-disgraced casino mogul. Wynn has denied all of the allegations.

He is now back - or at least his money is. In the past, Republicans demanded Democrats return money from Harvey Weinstein, who was later convicted of rape. In this case, Republicans have continued to accept Wynn's money.

GOP leaders, including Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Super PACs connected with him, have been the primary beneficiaries of Wynn's contributions. In fact, Wynn has given more than $6 million to 2020 political campaigns, which appears to be the largest amount he has ever individually donated. Among Wynn's contributions identified by NPR:

A $4 million donation to the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC closely allied with Mitch McConnell, and led by McConnell's former chief of staff.
$1.5 million in donations to American Crossroads, another McConnell-aligned Super PAC. Robert ""Mike"" Duncan, a longtime Republican Party official and chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, is among the Super PAC's board of directors.
A $25,000 donation to the McConnell Victory Committee, and an additional $5,600 directly to McConnell's senate campaign.
A $468,500 donation to Trump Victory, a fundraising committee supporting the President's re-election. Much of that donation was transferred to the Republican National Committee (RNC).
Around $200,000 in donations to entities connected with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).
$5,600 in donations to New York Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

The Trump Campaign referred NPR's inquiries to the RNC, which did not respond. McConnell's campaign declined to comment. The Senate Leadership Fund, American Crossroads, the NRSC and Stefanik's campaign did not respond to NPR's messages. Two attorneys who have represented Wynn also did not return messages seeking comment.
It's unclear whether Wynn may also be making additional donations to so-called ""dark money"" groups - political organizations that do not have to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission - but he has in the past. Between 2010 and 2012, when he was still the head of Wynn Resorts, the company donated half a million dollars to a conservative organization called Americans For Job Security. That donation was only revealed in 2019 after litigation by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

Wynn joined the ranks of political megadonors after making a fortune in his decades-long career in casinos. Wynn founded and led Wynn Resorts, running businesses in Macau, Las Vegas, and Boston.

In 2016, Donald Trump tapped Wynn, a friend and former rival in the casino business, to help lead fundraising efforts for the Republican Party. That year, he individually gave more than $1 million to political candidates and committees, followed by a $729,217 donation to President Trump's inauguration through his company.

Then, in Jan. 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that ""dozens"" of his employees had witnessed a ""a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn."" Subsequent investigations by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board detailed allegations against Wynn, including a "" non consensual sexual relationship"" with one employee, and complaints that Wynn inappropriately exposed himself to employees during massages.

The most serious allegation stemmed from 2005. A Wynn employee was called in to Steve Wynn's office to provide a manicure. The employee said that Wynn then raped her in a massage room connected to his office, according to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.

Wynn later testified in a separate civil lawsuit that he believed the encounter with his employee was consensual, though it reflected "" bad judgment on my part."" Wynn paid the woman a $7.5 million settlement on the condition that she sign a non-disclosure agreement. The company failed to ""conduct any investigation whatsoever"" into the rape allegation, the Commission found.

Victims ""felt that they didn't have a voice,"" the new CEO of Wynn Resorts, Matthew Maddox, told the Commission in 2019. ""That if they were to speak up they could be retaliated against. Or if they did, it would not be investigated. For that, I am truly sorry.""

Wynn has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, calling them ""preposterous."" He characterized the rape allegation as "" extortion."" He has not faced criminal charges. Still, he stepped down as CEO of his company. The head of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, said she ""removed"" Wynn from his role as finance chair of the Republican National Committee. Some Republicans, including Ohio Senator Rob Portman and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, donated contributions they'd received from Wynn to charity.

McDaniel and the RNC, on the other hand, told Fox News that they would keep Wynn's contributions, saying that Wynn ""should be allowed due process."" Still, McDaniel pledged in Jan. 2018 that if investigations of Wynn found ""any wrongdoing, we will absolutely return 100% of that money.""

Just a few months before that, in Oct. 2017, officials and advisors with Republican PACs criticized Democrats for taking contributions from Harvey Weinstein, the former movie producer who was later convicted of rape. McDaniel called Weinstein's money ""dirty.""

Under pressure from Republicans, top Democrats - such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Kamala Harris and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - pledged to donate Weinstein's contributions to charity or committees supporting female candidates for political office.

But now that the shoe is on the other foot, the RNC has taken a different stance. Despite the findings of casino regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, the RNC, McConnell, and top Republican officials have accepted Steve Wynn's contributions.

954,Florida professor who co-wrote book on organized crime charged with money laundering,"Video

Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 19

Fox News Flash top headlines for Nov. 19 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com

A Miami professor who co-authored a book on organized crime is accused of laundering millions in dirty money through his private U.S. bank accounts.

Bruce Bagley, 73, was arrested Monday on federal charges that he laundered corruption proceeds from Venezuela.

The University of Miami Professor appeared in Miami federal court and was freed on $300,000 bail. His attorney, Daniel Forman, told the Miami Herald that they planned to ""diligently defend his case.""

Bagley co-authored the 2015 book ""Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime and Violence in the Americas Today,"" and has testified before Congress and as an expert in court. He was widely regarded by multiple news outlets as the go-to expert on crime in the Americas.

William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the FBI's New York office, said in a release that Bagley profited by helping others launder the proceeds of their crimes.

""About the only lesson to be learned from Professor Bagley today is that involving oneself in public corruption, bribery, and embezzlement schemes is going to lead to an indictment,"" Sweeney said.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman in New York said Bagley opened bank accounts specifically to launder money for corrupt foreigners.

""The funds Bagley was allegedly laundering were the proceeds of bribery and corruption, stolen from the citizens of Venezuela,"" Berman said.

An indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court said that from November 2017 through April, Bagley agreed to receive about 14 deposits from bank accounts in Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates totaling $3 million.

According to the indictment, Bagley transferred the majority of the money into the bank accounts of a co-conspirator to conceal the nature, source and ownership of the funds.

Authorities said Bagley kept a 10 percent commission for himself from the money he laundered.

The University of Miami said in a statement that Bagley was placed on administrative leave.

""As this is a personal matter in an ongoing investigation, the University has no further comment at this time,"" the school said.

Bagley faces conspiracy to commit money laundering and two money laundering charges. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.",1
210,Households hounded by ‘aggressive’ debt collectors after 11 energy suppliers go bust in 18 months – your rights,"THOUSANDS of households are at risk of being hounded by ""aggressive"" debt collectors on behalf of energy companies after 11 smaller firms went bust in the past 17 months.

Charity Citizens Advice has warned that 32,000 households in debt to their suppliers could be chased for the cash by the administrators who took over these companies.

Since the start of 2018, 11 small energy firms have gone bust - Brilliant Energy, Economy Energy, Extra Energy, Spark Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, Usio Energy, One Select, and Electaphase Energy.

When energy suppliers fail, regulator Ofgem appoints a new provider for customers to ensure a continued energy supply, while the old supplier is taken over by administrators.

But where customers owe cash to their supplier it's up to the new provider whether to take these debts on.

What are your rights if you owe money to an energy firm?

ENERGY regulator Ofgem has set out rules energy firms must follow if you owe them money for any unpaid bills.

Firms must offer you a manageable repayment plan when paying off your debts.

When putting the plan together, they must take into account your other debts and how much you can afford to pay the firm.

Once you start paying them back, they have a responsibility to keep checking in with you to see if it's still manageable.

Debts that have been bought by an administrator don't have to follow these guidelines.

They have the right to send bailiffs to your home to collect the cash.

It can be extremely distressing to have a bailiff at your front door, but you have rights and shouldn't be bullied.

What are my rights when a bailiff visits my home?

Bailiffs can't enter your home:

By force, for example by pushing past you (unless in the below scenario)
If only children under 16 or vulnerable people (with disabilities, for example) are there
Between 9pm and 6am
Through anything except the door.

Things a bailiff can't take from you:

Things you need, such as your clothes, cooker or fridge
Work tools and equipment worth a total of less than £1,350
Someone else's belongs, such as your partner's computer. Just keep in mind you'll have to prove that someone else's goods don't belong to you.

If it doesn't it could leave the administrator chasing customers for the cash.

The problem is that Citizens Advice says administrators are not bound by the same rules as suppliers, which means they can pursue debts more aggressively.

It adds that this can leave customers asked for cash at very short notice and have the amounts they are being chased for go up overnight.

Since January 2018, Citizens Advice has helped over 1,000 people with debt issues related to failed suppliers, who owe £250 on average.

In a separate issue, Citizens Advice also warns that consumers could be footing a £172million bill for these firms going bust.

That's because other energy suppliers have to foot the bill for renewable generation, infrastructure and metering when a supplier goes under.

The charity fears that it will be passed onto consumers through hiked energy bills and debt collection from customers who owed the failed firms cash.

Is it safe to switch to a small energy provider?

FED-UP with sky high energy prices and poor customer service from the Big Six energy firms? Then you could save a packet by switching to a smaller firm.

Research from Which? has found customers with smaller and medium sized firms such as Utility Warehouse, Flow Energy and Octopus Energy are much happier than those with the major firms - and could save a whopping £333 a year by switching.

The biggest risk of choosing a small provider - like Our Power - is that it goes bust.

But remember that if the firm does go under you won't be cut off, and Ofgem will try and get a new supplier in place as quickly as it can.

Once it has done this, the new firm will contact you - it doesn't have to honour the deal you were on with the defunct firm - but under Ofgem rules any credit you have on your account is protected.

If you're unhappy with the new supplier's offer you are free to shop around for a new deal and switch - you won't have to pay any exit fees to leave.

Citizens Advice wants to see action to ""fix the protection gap"" for customers who owe money to energy suppliers when they collapse and that administrators should follow the same rules as suppliers.

It says as upcoming energy white paper - a Government report that proposes changes on issues - is the ideal opportunity for lawmakers to ""close the gap in protections and limit the cost to consumers of any future supplier failures"".

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Consumers shouldn't have to foot the multimillion-pound bill left behind when companies collapse - and they certainly shouldn't lose their usual protections in the process.""

Energy UK director of policy, Audrey Gallacher said that suppliers ""fully support"" existing consumer protection requirements to be extended to administrators.

She added: ""The increase in competition and the number of suppliers in recent years has been great for customers in providing choice and driving down prices.

""But we welcome Ofgem bringing in tougher checks for suppliers entering and operating in the market to ensure they have sustainable business models and are adequately financed to serve their customers.

""Ofgem now needs to ensure that the ongoing operation of companies is monitored to minimise the risk of additional costs being loaded on to consumers.""",0
556,UK anti-money laundering supervisors gotta up their game,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is calling on the nation’s anti-money laundering (AML) supervisors to raise their standards further.

The FCA’s Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervision (OPBAS) has today (19 March) released its latest report on tackling money laundering over the past year.

Among the key findings are that the accountancy and legal professions have made “strong improvements” in their AML work. However, some professional body supervisors (PBSs) are “still lagging behind their peers and must continue to raise their standards further”.

Megan Butler, FCA’s Executive Director of Supervision – Investment, Wholesale and Specialist, says: “We are pleased to see that OPBAS’ work is leading to positive changes in how professional bodies oversee the fight against dirty money. But there is still work to do, and in 12 months’ time we expect to see even greater improvements in AML measures.”

The report was also clear about the need for vigilance: “The human cost of financial crime is profound. Illicit finance enables serious organised crime. The tragic deaths of Vietnamese nationals in Essex, East of England last year provided a stark reminder of the true victims of money laundering. The harm associated with turning a blind eye is evident and clear.”

In that 27-page report, OBPAS reveals some positives. One year ago, 91% of relevant PBSs were not fully applying a risk-based approach to their supervision. One year on, only 14% are not yet driving supervisory activity by AML risk.

OBPAS also observed an increase in governance arrangements for AML supervision. A year ago, 44% of PBSs lacked clear accountability for their supervisory work. This figure had reached zero by the end of 2019.

It also went on to list areas for improvement. For example, 41% of relevant PBSs did not take any kind of enforcement action for AML non-compliance; and 40% of PBSs were not members of established intelligence sharing systems. In addition, when it comes to decision-making, 32% of PBSs lacked formal procedures.",0
256,The migrant crisis and the growth of populist movements,"The victory of populist parties

On March 4, 2018, Italians went to the polls and delivered a sharp rebuke to traditional parties. The Five Star Movement was the clear winner, claiming nearly one-third of the vote, but it lacked an obvious path to forming a coalition government. Support for both the ruling PD and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia plummeted; although the PD secured just enough votes to theoretically forge a coalition with Five Star, representatives from both parties adamantly ruled out such a possibility. The League, the Euroskeptic anti-immigration successor to the secessionist Northern League, captured a stunning 18 percent of the vote. This result was especially remarkable because support for the League was largely confined to a relatively narrow band north of the Po River. Also gaining representation was the Brothers of Italy, a descendant of the neofascist National Alliance.

Coalition talks dragged on for two inconclusive months, and on May 7 Italian Pres. Sergio Mattarella delivered a televised address urging parties to appoint a nonpartisan caretaker government under the threat of fresh elections. Five Star vowed that it would not take part in a unity technocratic government, and League leader Matteo Salvini called for a new election that would double as a de facto referendum on Italy’s membership in the European Union. In an effort to resolve the impasse, Berlusconi—as head of the right-wing bloc that included the League, Forza Italia, and the Brothers of Italy—gave his blessing to Salvini to pursue negotiations with Five Star. Days later the ban on Berlusconi holding political office was lifted by a Milan appellate court. As talks between Salvini and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio proceeded, there emerged the possibility of a Euroskeptic, left and right populist coalition that EU officials dubbed the “nightmare scenario.”

The two parties agreed on an administration to be led by Giuseppe Conte, a law professor and political neophyte. On May 27 Mattarella vetoed Conte’s government, however, on the grounds that proposed finance minister Paolo Savona was a Euroskeptic who would seek to “provoke Italy’s exit from the euro.” The move triggered howls of protest from Five Star, with Di Maio calling for Mattarella’s impeachment, and Italian bond yields soared at the prospect of continued political instability. On May 29 Mattarella sought to calm markets by nominating former IMF executive Carlo Cottarelli to serve at the head of a technocratic caretaker government ahead of early elections. Cottarelli was known as “Mr. Scissors” for his reputation as an opponent of public spending, but his appointment failed to assuage investors. In the end, Cottarelli surrendered his mandate after just 48 hours when Five Star and the League again proposed Conte as prime minister at the head of a reshuffled cabinet. Mattarella approved the government on May 31, and Conte was inaugurated the following day.

114,Deconstructing the Philippines’ New Anti-Terrorism Law,"Kanak Mishra, a final year law student at O. P. Jindal Global Law University in Sonepat, India, discusses the arbitrariness of the new anti-terrorism law passed by Philippines in relation to international human rights law...

Rodrigo Duterte’s presidential term in the archipelagic country of the Philippines has been deeply concerning human rights activists since 2016. Immediately after assuming the Presidency, Duterte confirmed that he had personally killed three men when he was the Mayor of Davao to show the police that killing troublemakers should not be difficult.

Amid a deadly pandemic, the controversial President has urgently passed a new Anti-Terrorism Law. Prima facie, the law is believed to have come into effect to counter Islamic militancy in the south of the country. However, the law blatantly disregards human rights and actively suppresses any dissent. It is also expected to raise targeted and systemic killings, especially against illegal drug dealers in the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, recently released a report highlighting the systemic killings being carried out in the country under Duterte’s regime as a means to counter illegal selling of drugs, which is in absolute disregard of the legal process. Amnesty International has also taken cognizance of Duterte’s targeted killing of the poor by condemning it as “nothing but a large-scale murdering enterprise”.

According to the new law, any individual can be ‘branded’ as a terrorist for being suspected of committing or assisting in committing a ‘deemed’ terrorist act under Sections 4 to 12 of the legislation. None of the Sections in the legislation attempt to lay down explicitly as to what acts, in particular, would amount to terrorist acts. It can be said that the legislation does not lay down any concrete mechanism through which the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) would have to justify the branding of any individual as a ‘terrorist’. The absence of the liability of the ATC to provide any justification or reasons for classifying an individual as a terrorist implies the unabashed arbitrariness of the legislation. The exercise of powers as grave as these would be in clear violation of the natural justice principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’. Thus, by violating this principle, the law also contravenes Article 14(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides for the right to a fair trial, thereby recognizing the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty as an important human right.

The law has obnoxiously widened the scope of terrorism by categorizing the destruction of all public properties as acts of terrorism. In Section 3 of the legislation, i.e., the definitions clause, public property is referred to as ‘critical infrastructure’. While the flowery language used in the text of the statute might seem convincing, it is a complete farce that considers even the slightest destruction of property as an act of terrorism. The definition of critical infrastructure ranges from telecommunications, water, energy, and food to radio and television assets. Additionally, it also criminalizes the destruction of any asset or system, the working of which is ‘vital to societal functions’. Considering that any dissent or protests are carried out primarily to oppose the existing societal functioning, the language of the text is very vague in its understanding of whether it seeks to criminalize dissent or destruction of property.

The definition of terrorism has been overextended to punish an individual for 12 years for inciting others through “speeches, writings, proclamations, emblems, banners, and other representations tending to the same end”. This constitutes a blatant suppression of the freedom of the press. The right to freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948.

Under Section 45 of the legislation, the President shall appoint an Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) that would comprise of the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and National Defense among others. The functions of the ATC are laid down in Section 46 of the legislation. The main functions of the ATC are to formulate and adopt plans and relevant measures to counter-terrorism, direct speedy trials, monitor the investigation process to establish a comprehensive database of terrorist activities and organizations, and take actions in compliance with UN Resolutions.

The ATC has unbridled power under Section 29 of the legislation in terms of ‘detention without judicial warrant of arrest’. This Section allows a person suspected of committing or assisting in terrorism to be put into preventive detention for a maximum of 24 days. Section 29(1) defines the period of custody as 14 days. But, Section 29(2) allows the ATC to extend the period of detention to a maximum of 10 more days on vague grounds such as preservation of evidence, completion of the investigation, necessity for further detention, and to conduct investigation ‘properly and without any delay’. Since the ATC members are appointed by the President himself, it is evident that they would be acting under his orders.

The Philippine government has defended the law by asserting that it does not go against International Human Rights Law. The President has tried to pacify lawyers by saying that law-abiding citizens should not fear the Anti-Terrorism Law as it is only meant to counter-terrorism. However, despite all these defenses, the people of the Philippines are protesting against this law mainly because it has the potential to conduct systemic killings, suppress dissent, and curb free speech in the country. Several rights groups, critics, lawyers, and indigenous people across the country have called the law ‘ draconian ’ and a ‘ perilous piece of legislation ’. In light of the severe and life-threatening attacks on human rights defenders and critics of the government including activists, journalists, lawyers, church leaders, trade union leaders, and individuals and groups affiliated with the political left, the Human Rights Council has adopted Resolution 41/2 to address the deterioration of human rights in Philippines.

But merely addressing the problem and being politically correct is not enough. Human Rights bodies have to actively step up to devise concrete measures to ensure that such grave and vicious human rights violations seize at the earliest. The Philippines, on the other hand, ought to direct its focus to reforming existing public and legal institutions instead of coming up with dangerous laws like the Anti-Terrorism Law. Considering the terrorism, corruption, and lawlessness prevalent in the country, the government should introspect the root causes of such problems rather than acting up and engaging in illegal acts itself. The need of the hour demands international players to act in solidarity in order to abolish the systemic and targeted killings of the poor and indigenous people of the country.",0
91,NS8 raises $123M led by Lightspeed for its suite of online fraud prevention tools,"Online fraud costs people and organizations billions of dollars each year — with one aspect alone, identity fraud, a $16.9 billion problem in 2019, says Javelin Research, and each dollar of spend online estimated to cost $3.13 in fraud recovery, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Today, a startup that’s built a platform to identify and prevent fraud across a range of e-commerce-related cases is announcing a large round of growth funding to help bring those numbers down.

NS8, a Las Vegas-based startup that provides tools to prevent fraud within e-commerce marketplaces, online merchants, payments gateways and ticketing services, has raised $123 million in venture funding, money that it plans to use to expand its technology and product stacks and to continue expanding the network of partners that it covers, which today includes commerce platforms Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento and WooCommerce.

“Thanks to this investment from Lightspeed, AXA Venture Partners, and our full backing group, we can continue to scale to meet the growing demand for fraud prevention technology in the global marketplace,” said NS8 CEO and co-founder Adam Rogas, said in a statement. “This partnership positions NS8 to empower even more businesses with enterprise-level fraud defenses, regardless of size or industry.”

The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with backing also from AXA Venture Partners, and has the additional distinction of being the largest-ever venture funding for a startup out of Vegas to date, the company notes (based on PitchBook data).

The company is not disclosing its valuation, but it looks like it has raised just over $150 million overall, with the first tranche of this latest, outsized, round closing in May of this year. It says it’s seen growth of 200% in year-on-year revenues, in part due to the surge of demand because of the coronavirus pandemic and the push for many merchants (and their customers) to take business online.

Vegas is synonymous with gambling and a history of nefarious activity connected to that; it seems that this is not exactly the germination of NS8’s business.

Rogas, who co-founded the company with Eric Kay, David Hansen and Sean Clauretie, is a graduate of UNLV who studied hotel administration and computer science and had worked at and founded a number of other digital businesses before this. The NS8 team now numbers 200 employees across its HQ in the city, plus offices in San Francisco, San Ramon, Miami, Amsterdam, Singapore and Melbourne.

The rise of NS8, and companies like it, comes at a time when we are getting generally much more sophisticated when it comes online fraud.

Many (but not all) transactions now require more than just card numbers to be processed, and those handling payments (for example, Stripe’s Radar service) have developed sophisticated, AI-based systems to track and identify strange activity.

Developments like these have helped to slow the growth of fraud, for sure, but at the same time e-commerce has continued to grow — not least because of situations like the current one, where people are increasing online shopping and decreasing in-person payments to follow through on coronavirus-related social distancing rules. So, despite the many advances, fraud continues to outstrip them.

NS8’s particular approach has been a platform that integrates with the companies that are providing e-commerce tools to businesses that are building online storefronts, and provide them with an all-in-one toolkit to monitor all activity on the site in an easy way. Its tools include scoring technology, data analytics, behavioral analytics, customer verification, ad campaign scoring and performance monitoring. The key for investors has been the ease of integration and use of the platform, and the fact that it works across so many different commerce tools.

“Online fraud prevention has grown rapidly due to the acceleration of ecommerce adoption by merchants and, with it, an increased threat of those seeking to attack online stores. Merchants of all sizes need to invest in security products to ensure a safe and secure online experience,” said Bradley Twohig, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, in a statement. “NS8’s platform allows its partners and their merchants to stand up a full-service fraud prevention hub, in a matter of a day, across almost every ecommerce platform. The time to value is simply best in class.”

“NS8 has built a market-leading fraud detection and prevention platform combining advanced data analytics with real-time scoring. NS8’s rapid growth is a testament to the strength of the company’s product and the value NS8 delivers to its customers,” said Alex Scherbakovsky, general partner at AXA Venture Partners and NS8 board member, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Adam and the NS8 team to scale the business globally.”",0
166,Pakistan says it is committed to fighting money laundering,"Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan’s government says it is focused on implementing a slew of new anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws.

The government’s comments come after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body, last week kept Pakistan on a watchlist of countries which do not meet the organisation’s criteria to restrict the funding of “terror” groups.

The FATF extended its evaluation of the country as a “jurisdiction with strategic deficiencies”, keeping it on its so-called “grey list”.

“Pakistan has been able to demonstrate tangible, effective and sustained progress towards the earliest completion of its [FATF] action plan,” Lubna Farooq Malik, director-general of the government’s Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) which is overseeing the response to the FATF, told Al Jazeera in a statement.

“Since February 2020 […], Pakistan has focused on sustainability and irreversibility of its efforts in the implementation of the action plan by completely revamping its [anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing] legal framework.

“As a result, Pakistan has successfully put in place an effective legal framework complemented by an equally robust institutional mechanism to address [those] concerns,” Malik said on Monday.

On Sunday, the cabinet minister working on the response to the FATF also said the country was shifting its focus from setting up laws and processes to now implementing them.

“These laws reflect clearance of back log of last 10 years,” said Hammad Azhar on Twitter. “The [government of Pakistan is] now focusing on implementation of these laws for effectiveness [and] evaluation planned ahead.”

The FATF has been closely evaluating Pakistan’s progress on combatting money laundering and terrorism financing since 2018, when it reclassified the country as being at risk of blacklisting for non-compliance with international recommendations.

Isolating Pakistan

Blacklisting by the FATF would result in Pakistan being isolated in certain ways from the international banking system, raising the costs of doing business domestically and with the external sector.

On Friday, FATF and its 37 member states ruled to extend Pakistan’s period of evaluation as it works on a 27-point action plan issued by the body to bring the country’s financial regulations and investigating agencies in line with the organisation’s requirements.

“The FATF takes note of the significant progress made on a number of action plan items,” the body said in a statement released at the conclusion of its plenary session.

“To date, Pakistan has made progress across all action plan items and has now largely addressed 21 of the 27 action items. As all action plan deadlines have expired, the FATF strongly urges Pakistan to swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2021.”

The move to continue evaluation but certify progress has been taken as a victory by the Pakistani government, which will continue to work with the FATF and other stakeholders ahead of the group’s next meeting in February.

“FATF has acknowledged our high-level political commitment and significant progress. [The] consensus decision without any voting is our diplomatic victory,” said Azhar.

‘A specific risk’

Progress on the plan has not always been so swift and the risks of Pakistan being blacklisted were far higher a year ago, analysts and observers say.

“It was very clear that Pakistan had a specific risk of terrorism financing, with porous borders, hawala/hundi [forms of cash transfer that exist outside the banking system], and proscribed [armed] organisations as well,” Jamal Aziz, executive director at the Islamabad-based Research Society of International Law (RSIL), told Al Jazeera.

“It was relatively easy to see that the state entities responsible for reporting on this were not operating in the way that our international obligations required of us.”

Aziz has worked with the government on its response to the FATF’s action plan, and says that the state’s initial response did not make much concrete progress.

“It took a while to get the machinery in order. These are such cross-cutting things, that it was unclear who were the leading agencies and who was responsible for what,” he says of the early days of Pakistan’s response.

In the last year, however, analysts and the state say, the country has made much more significant progress, passing more than a dozen new laws related to money laundering, terrorism financing and increasing financial regulation.

“In the first year, there was little progress, but in the last year and a half there has been considerable work, and we have been submitting to FATF the progress made so far,” said government official Malik.

Aziz says that in the first year, authorities took more “kinetic action”, moving against armed groups and seizing assets, without implementing the systematic changes that FATF required.

“We did the same things we’ve done before. Closed seminaries, banned outfits and confiscated assets,” he says. “But in the second quarter of 2019, we saw a shift in approach. The foreign ministry issued guidelines on how UN sanctions are to be implemented [in Pakistan]. Who is responsible for what. [The National Counter Terrorism Authority] issued guidelines on the same thing, and on how parallel investigations were to be conducted as well. That brought some technical clarity.”

The result, he says, is that there is now a system for cross-institutional cooperation on combatting money laundering and terrorism financing, one that did not exist before.

“The processes and understanding of the state institutions on this has now become very good. It now permeates through the system. Before you could issue a notification and that would not necessarily lead to anything. Now it links to the banks, to [other institutions], and it has processes on the ground that have become part of it,” he says.

In a statement, the Financial Monitoring Unit told Al Jazeera that the state’s approach has become four-pronged, working on risk evaluation, prevention through greater use of systematic processes, increasing the use of financial intelligence in criminal prosecutions and working with international partners on coordination.

Implementation, however, remains a major challenge, say analysts.

“There are a lot of issues to do with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, the central bank, getting the right legislation on anti-money laundering through, but also getting prosecutions and convictions,” says Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist.

“It’s not just about having the rules in place, but FATF also wants to see them being enforced. [You need to] not just [have] the right rules, but show visible signs that they are being enforced.”

Economic costs

Activities such as money laundering hurt the economy because they divert funds away from regular banking channels, making it hard for the government to collect taxes. The coronavirus has made tax revenue collection even harder.

[Bloomberg]

One estimate puts the amount of illegal wealth in Pakistan at 56 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

But Husain says the tighter regulations themselves have come with an economic cost.

“[Grey listing by the FATF] has affected the economy in the sense that there are more cumbersome rules in place for the conduct of normal banking. Many of the loopholes that FATF is trying to close down to shut down access to criminals and terrorists, many of those are used by the informal sector as well, on a very large scale,” he said.

Amir Rana, director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, says that while the government has passed tough legislation in the last 12 months, seeing how those laws are enforced and training prosecutors to use them will take more time.

“Prosecution is quite weak here in Pakistan and is yet to be addressed,” Rana says. “The quality of prosecution and trial, investigations, there is still a lot to do in these areas.”

Pakistan has made some progress in arresting high-profile leaders on terrorism financing charges in the last year, an area where there were previously clear deficiencies on prosecutions and convictions.

In February, a Lahore anti-terrorism court convicted Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba armed group, to five and a half years in prison in a case related to terrorism financing.

In August, three more leaders of his group charged with similar offences were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 18 months to 16 years.

Also in August, Pakistan’s parliament passed a law overhauling its anti-money laundering structures, instituting a new high-powered committee headed by the finance minister and including officials from the country’s powerful military and intelligence services to oversee anti-money laundering efforts.

Looking forward, the big challenge will be how these new structures and processes function, and whether new policies are implemented correctly, says Aziz.

“In our system, the lapse still remains that our [prosecutions are] still dependent on security operations or police personnel conducting raids, and then they use the [terrorism financing] laws against those arrested,” he says, “… rather than someone being flagged on interaction with the financial system [through financial intelligence], which would be more proactive.”

That kind of change, however, will take time.

“You can’t show effectiveness when processes are this new. For realistic change, you can’t just make laws and expect them to work. You have to show how they’re operating, and give them a teething period as well.”",0
522,Lost and Found in Uzbekistan,"The Korean Story

Victoria Kim

Introduction

Strolling along the streets of Tashkent or riding in a small marshrutka minibus – a common mode of transportation in this busy and bustling with life Central Asian city with a population of about 3 million people – you would feel no surprise looking at the multitude of different faces...

Tanned and dark haired or rather white skinned and blond, with blue, green or brown eyes, Russians, Tartars or Koreans would always appear in the crowd of local Uzbeks.

There used to be even more of them here several decades ago, living together in this calm and friendly city full of sunshine and welcoming shade…

By now, many people have left together with their untold stories – about this capital of “sun and bread”, a Soviet-day Babylon that became a true Noah’s ark hosting and hiding the survivors of a horrifying storm of ethnic repressions.

Here, lost deep in the heart of Central Asian desert, they multiplied, prospered and lived in peace. Russians, Jews, Germans, Armenians, Meskhetian Turks, Chechens, Crimean Tartars and Greeks, most of them had found their second home here, temporary if not permanent.

After the Soviet Union’s breakup in 1991, many ethnic groups abandoned this newly rising and predominantly Muslim country. Ones feared possible persecutions - which fortunately never happened - while others simply followed their own practical reasons.

Some left as soon as the restrictions on their movement were lifted in the wave of so called “democratization” early in the 1970s.

However, there was one particular community of people that chose to stay in Uzbekistan. They actually had nowhere else to go. Over the years of pain and suffering, hard physical labor, adaptation and assimilation, this country had become their one and only true home.

These people are Uzbek Koreans, and this story is about them.

Nikolay Ten

Nikolay and I were simply bound to meet. When I saw him first on the calm and quiet streets of Tashkent in the early spring of 2014, he was selling souvenirs, antiques and traditional Uzbek clay figurines to passersby and tourists in the central city square formerly known as Broadway.

Several theaters it used to host were long time gone as were the frequenting them crowds. The name has somehow stuck, adding nostalgia and curious mystery to this huge and otherwise deserted area full of flowerbeds and monuments to fallen heroes.

Only a handful of artists, painters and antiquity collectors remained here, including Nikolay, a small and aging Korean man who would pass anywhere for a “typical” Central Asian. He looked more like a Kyrgyz, Kazakh or Mongol, with his bold head, dark skin burnt out by the sun and swollen eyelids.

Something very special on his smooth and round face was his smile – a kind, honest and hesitant smile of a thoughtful child he still kept somewhere deep in his heart.

I bounced into Nikolay in the middle of my own personal quest. I was looking for a story almost disappeared and now hidden somewhere near. The ghosts of our recent past were haunting me from all sides on that warm and cloudy spring day on Broadway, and probably, they brought me to Nikolay and made him reveal his story to me.

At the same time, the urge to keep telling this story is somehow very understandable for both of us. These are our collective memories imprinted in the genes of all Uzbek Koreans.

They are still kept in the taste of pigodi, chartagi, khe or kuksi – a handful of salty and spicy North Korean dishes that have become a representative part of our vibrant and mixed Uzbek cuisine.

They still resonate in the sound of a few remaining words in Hamgyong dialect, which Soviet Koreans originally spoke when they first arrived to Uzbekistan in 1937.

They still mark our ancient lunar calendar during the traditional holidays, such as Hansik and Chusok – spring and autumn equinoxes – or tol and hwangab – the auspicious first and sixtieth birthday celebrations.

These ancient and typically Korean festivities and cultural rituals have somehow survived all former official prohibitions and are vigorously observed across Uzbekistan by one unique ethnic group.

This very tight community also shares a deeply secretive history known through the tragic accounts of past persecutions, repressions and deaths. These stories would only be told to close relatives and passed among family members, from one generation to another.

The sufferings those stories unveil are always very deep. Equally deep is the pain the memories still provoke...

My Grandfather

I also have a story woven into the secrets of this tragic past. Long time ago, my grandfather told it to me only once and never wanted to speak about it again.

This is the story of a little boy who traveled one cold winter with many other people, all stuck together inside a dark and stinking cattle train...

He traveled on that train together with his parents and siblings for many weeks, until one day they arrived to a strange place in the middle of nowhere...

That place was somewhere in Soviet Uzbekistan. It was 1937, and my grandfather was only seven years old.

What brought him to the empty and deserted Central Asia together with all other people was the first Soviet deportation of entire nationality.

What united all of them as the victims of this massive deportation was their ethnic belonging. They all happened to be Koreans.

The cattle train story was the only thing my grandfather ever told me about those painful and complicated times. Yet, all his untold stories would keep haunting me later on, as would also do so his very apparent Korean physic and our Korean last name.

In order to affirm my partly Korean belonging, I would eventually study Korean or rather its classical Seoul dialect, which my grandfather would never be able to understand.

I would keep looking for any affinity with Korea and even graduate in the Korean studies at a renown university in the US, which my grandfather would still happily live to know.

So far from my actual Korean roots and never at peace with this understanding, I would keep looking for those unique Korean stories forgotten and lost deep in Central Asian sands...

It would become my personal quest to uncover the secret spaces left blank on purpose, in our family history and in the history of all Uzbek Koreans.

My grandfather has lived a relatively successful life in Uzbekistan. He went to study in Moscow and was later sent to work in rural Ukraine, where he met his future Russian wife who was working in the same town. They returned to Tashkent together in 1957, already married and with my one year old mother.

For most of his life, my grandfather worked as a chief engineer in the construction bureau at a major industrial plant in Tashkent. He developed and patented a lot of technical innovations for cotton picking machinery – we still keep all his certificates of achievement at home.

This is how the Korean community is ingrained in our social fabric – as extremely hard working people and quite a prosperous diaspora. In fact, many Koreans – including Nikolay’s mother and my grandfather – have been awarded with numerous state medals for their very hard labor during the Soviet times.

Uzbek Koreans are also known for their indisputable role in the development of our national agriculture.

Traditional peasants, they passed to locals all their generations acquired land farming knowledge and techniques. Even now, the best types of rice grown in our country and used in the preparation of most representative Uzbek dishes are still lovingly called “Korean”.

However, little is known about the heavy toll Uzbek Koreans had to pay in order to gain such a high reputation in our society. They were forced to come to this land, they had to develop it and turn into their own, they bore children upon it and – very slowly – it became their one and only home.

Nikolay and I are desperate to preserve our history – in the name of all Korean people. This is the story of three generations of his family. It is also my grandfather’s story. Nikolay and I are determined to keep it alive, so the history may never repeat itself.

At least, we truly hope so.

Before 1937

Nikolay’s mother was born in 1919 in Maritime province, in the village called Crabs. Back then it belonged to Posyet national district, and the whole territory of this province was an official part of the Soviet Far East.

In fact, this tiny piece of land – stuck between north-eastern China and the upper tip of present-day North Korea on one side, and surrounded with the Japanese Sea on the other – used to serve as a buffer zone for the Soviets throughout most of the 1920s.

Koreans originally started moving here in the late 19th century, escaping harsh living conditions, poverty and starvation in the north of the Korean peninsula.

In the Russian Far East, they built their first Korean villages and towns; very often with the agreement of Russian provincial governments and local military forces who desperately needed cheap labor in order to develop this desolated land full of opportunities and natural resources.

Initially, the first Russian settlers in the Far East felt quite hostile to unexpected newcomers. Koreans belonged to a different race, spoke an unfamiliar and unheard before language, ate strange food and had very different cultural habits.

However and in spite of the initial hostility and ethnic discrimination against them, by the early 1900s the amount of Koreans populating northern Russia grew to almost 30,000 from the original 13 families found by a Russian military convoy along the Tizinhe River in 1863.

Subsequently, this number more than doubled after Korea became a Japanese protectorate in 1905 and Japanese colony in 1910, and more than tripled by the early 1920s. With the Korean peninsula agonizing in a bloody turmoil, more and more Koreans were now helplessly fleeing to Russia.

After the Soviet revolution, all ethnic Koreans in the Russian Far East were issued Soviet citizenship, even in spite of the fact that most of their representations and activities such as local governments, schools, theaters and newspapers, kept operating mostly in the Korean language.

Many Koreans became active contributors to the Soviet society. Nikolay’s grandfather Vasiliy Lee was one of them. Throughout the civil war in the Russian Far East in 1918-1922, he fought together with the Bolsheviks against the Japanese under the command of Sergey Lazo who later became famous all over Soviet Union.

However, the fact that they truly hated the Japanese aggressors who had colonized and brutalized their historical motherland did not spare Soviet Koreans from their “dubious” ethnicity and “dangerous” links to Japan in the eyes of Soviet leadership and high military command.

Even before – by the end of Russo-Japanese war in 1905 – Korean peasants in the Russian Far East were often laid off the land they had cultivated, with anti-Korean laws effectively applied against them since 1907.

Now in 1937, shortly after having conducted the official census that counted over 170,000 Koreans living in the Soviet Union in almost 40,000 families, the Soviet government was preparing another ordeal for them, much more horrid in its scope and future implications...

Vasiliy Lee

It was a dark and cold autumn night of 1937. Nikolay’s grandfather Vasiliy, his wife and three daughters, including 18 years old Nikolay’s mother Galina and her 24 and 20 years old sisters, were all at home when someone suddenly knocked the door.

They were from the Soviet secret police. The order was simple and quick: “Gather all your belongings, personal documents and all food you can find at home in less than half an hour and follow us immediately. You all are being deported.”

This is how the population of entire Posyet Korean national district – or 171,781 ethnic Koreans from there and the rest of Soviet Far East – were mounted on cattle trains in the matter of hours and at the beginning of harsh Siberian winter, without any prior notice and with practically no food, water, warm clothes or personal belongings.

All of them were being sent off to the Soviet Union’s first massive labor camps deep in Central Asia.

The train journey was very long and exhausting. It lasted several weeks in dire cold, and the soldiers who guarded the cattle trains shared no food or water with the Korean deportees. In such conditions, people were quickly dying from malnutrition, and their bodies were being left in the snow outside each train station.

During these very brief stops at unfamiliar stations, the deportees were trying to sell to local residents – or simply exchange for food – any objects of value they managed to bring along in this extremely hard journey. They also collected snow and melted it into water.

This is how Nikolay’s mother Galina and her two elder sisters survived, thanks to their parents’ ceaseless care and initial food supply from home. Nikolay’s grandparents were giving away their own food and water to their three daughters. Like that, they didn’t last long and died eventually on that train from the starvation and weakness...

Their bodies were abandoned outside a small and unknown train station – one of many on this horrendous journey. Until now, nobody knows the exact place of their final rest. Together with his wife, a hero of the Soviet civil war in the Far East has forever disappeared in the snow…

Galina and Konstantin

Nikolay’s father Konstantin has also survived the journey, together with his parents and two brothers. He did not meet his future wife on the train. Instead, they met later upon their arrival to Uzbekistan.

When the Koreans arrived, they were lodged in special barracks under 24/7 armed guard. During the day, they had to dry wet swampland and root out the cane surrounding Uzbek capital Tashkent back then.

‘It was a hell of a job’, Nikolay remembered from his parents’ stories. ‘There were a lot of wolves, jackals and lynxes in the swampland. During the night, they would come very close to temporary shacks in the fields where the Koreans lived and scare everyone to death’.

Death was indeed crawling and waiting nearby, but in the form of much tinier creatures. Wet swampland was infested with malaria mosquitoes, and many Koreans – unprotected and with no medicines at hand – would quickly get sick and eventually die from malaria.

Nevertheless, in less than five years from the deportees’ original arrival to Soviet Uzbekistan, all cane was rooted out and the swampland surrounding Tashkent was made arable.

After they had completed this gigantic task, the Koreans were ordered to start growing rice on the new arable land in order to produce agricultural supply for the Soviet state.

This is when Nikolay’s parents met and fell in love, working together in the fields. They got married in 1940 – she was 21 and he was 23.

From the initial barracks and shacks under 24/7 armed guard, they could eventually move together into a tiny house they built themselves out of straw and mud.

All rice they grew and harvested had to be returned to the state. For any hidden amount if discovered, the person who committed the crime would be pledged guilty of collective property theft and go directly to prison.

This is how the first Korean collective farms or kolkhozes started operating, built around the very same rice fields the deportees had to farm and live on. Now they lived in tiny houses made of straw and mud instead of initial barracks and shacks.

Many got married and bore their children on this land that also started to give its very first fruit. The armed guard control and passport restrictions had lasted until it was understood the Koreans would not go anywhere.

In fact, they had nowhere else to go. With so many difficulties, they built their first houses and started their families in this foreign place that finally – slowly and painfully – became their own...

After 1953

In late 1953, the death of Joseph Stalin marked the end of his personality cult and stopped persecutions of ethnic minorities.

Many of Stalin’s policies were declared contradicting the true principles of Leninism in 1956 and subsequently abandoned by a newly rising political leader, Nikita Khrushchev.

Pardoning all Soviet Union’s unwanted people and dissolving the infamous gulags – Siberian prison camps – were among his first political decisions taken in order to attempt correcting the mistakes of a very dark past.

Finally, it looked like the Koreans were given a new chance to become legitimate Soviet citizens.

Their children could now go to public primary, secondary and vocational high schools and local universities. They could also move relatively freely within the Soviet Union and look for better professional opportunities.

Paradoxically, most of them stayed in the very same Korean kolkhozes they or their parents initially arrived to and built.

Their living conditions were more stable there, in the tight communities where everyone belonged to the same ethnic group and personally knew each other.

Now their children were also coming back – often as graduates of prestigious state universities all over the USSR – and given jobs of highly trained staff in agricultural, managerial and technical positions at the same kolkhozes.

Life slowly regained its normality... The first generations of Korean deportees had been trying very hard to forget their dark past, together with all its previous mistakes and pain. They simply wanted to live happier lives, if not of their own then at least of their children.

Early memories

Nikolay saw real bread for the first time in his life at the age of five. Before that his mother had always used compressed grass to “bake” bread of some kind. It was so heavy to digest that all children suffered from severe stomach aches, especially after eating a lot of it.

In the early 1950s, they all lived with constant food shortages, little Nikolay, his mother and two elder sisters (the third one would be born ten years later).

‘We had a cow, some chicken and a pig. My dad had left to study at a pedagogical university, and my mother was left alone with three little children, taking care of our house and the animals.’

This is why she finally stopped working in a kolkhoz – there always was plenty of work at home. During the nights and after everyone had left to sleep, she was still awake, secretly sewing clothes, to be later sold to neighbors.

All forms of private entrepreneurship were strictly prohibited back then by the Soviet state. Therefore, Galina’s nighttime work simply had to stay hidden.

‘I was always playing outside the house as a little boy’, Nikolay remembers very emotionally, ‘and if I suddenly saw anyone around who didn’t look Korean, I would immediately run back to my mother and shout “Inspector is coming, inspector is coming!”’

Galina worked so hard during the day and in her nighttime shifts of sewing that eventually she lost all of her breast milk she still had to feed Nikolay with.

‘I had to start drinking cow milk way too early, because my mom was so stressed during the day and so tired of sleepless nights that there was no more milk left in her to feed me...’

Eventually, Galina was able to find a legal job in a state-owned tailor shop. Konstantin came back after finishing the university and became a math teacher at a local school.

He worked as a math teacher for the rest of his life. They both were awarded with medals for their very hard lifelong labor.

Fedor Lee

There is one memory especially painful for Nikolay. It is the memory of a very dark night back at home. He was still a very small child.

As a three-year old, Nikolay could vividly remember everything around him. That night he was peacefully sleeping in his bed, when the adult voices suddenly woke him up.

Nikolay walked into the living room and saw a crying Korean stranger. He was telling something to Nikolay’s parents who were also crying while listening to him...

Nikolay still cries himself like a small child, telling me this story 60 years later.

When his mother came to Soviet Uzbekistan as a deportee in the cattle train together with her parents and sisters, her brother was left behind. He was only 21 and served in the Soviet military back in the Far East.

He was positioned in Kraskino town and separated from the rest of his family who lived in Crabs. When Stalin’s order for the deportation of Koreans came in power, he discovered that his whole family had been shipped to Uzbekistan on a train only very shortly before his own arrest.

As a soldier, Fedor Lee was under an even higher suspicion and scrutiny than the rest of the Koreans. According to an official version, he was accused by his neighbors of being a Japanese spy and quickly declared a traitor and enemy of the Soviet state.

Fedor was condemned to ten years of forced labor in the Siberian gulag in Komi Soviet Socialist Republic. There he did not last even through the first half of his imprisonment.

The Korean stranger who visited Nikolay’s family fifteen years later was his uncle’s fellow prisoner in the gulag. He told Nikolay’s parents that Koreans were treated the worst by the guards among gulag prisoners, and only a couple of them eventually survived all horrors of their imprisonment.

Every day they were sent to cut lumber deep in the Siberian woods, in spite of freezing temperatures, lack of clothes and malnutrition.

Fedor badly injured his legs while cutting a tree, and in the cold weather gangrene developed very quickly.

Even after he could not walk any longer, his comrade would remember, they still had to take him out to their working station, where he would cut branches from fallen trees.

After he got so weak that he could not work any longer, the prison guards shot him. It happened in the early 1940s, and nobody really knew where his body had been buried.

‘My family was taken on a train all the way to Uzbekistan’, Fedor told his Korean comrade shortly before dying.

‘If you manage to survive through all of this, please promise me you would go and find them… Please promise you would tell them my story, everything they have done to me.’

His friend, whose name we will never know, fulfilled his promise. He found Fedor’s family and came all the way to Uzbekistan to tell them everything that had happened to Fedor.

Alexey Ten

It seems that in the lives of some there can never be too much suffering…

The lives of two generations of Nikolay’s grandparents and parents bear clear signs of two waves of repressions against the ethnic Koreans and political prisoners of the Soviet state between the early 1930s and late 1950s.

There is, however, one more story left to tell and one more wave of repressions left to count. It took place exactly at the same time and became one of – if not the most – secretive part of history in the lives of Soviet Koreans. This is the story not so many people happen to know about…

Alexey Ten came to Uzbekistan on the same cattle train, together with his brother and Nikolay’s father Konstantin.

Together they worked in the swampland and later rice fields, and then Alexey went to study in the Chirchiq military academy near Tashkent, where in the early 1950s he was approached with an unexpected order by his higher military command.

The special request came from the young Comrade Kim Il Sung handpicked by Joseph Stalin in the indirect stand-off between the Soviet Union and United States over the Korean peninsula. Eventually, it led to the Korean War, which became known in the West as the Forgotten War.

Back then, young and energetic Comrade Kim Il Sung sent a direct plea of help to all brotherly Soviet Koreans, asking those in the military ranks to fight the Korean War shoulder to shoulder with him, in order to liberate the Korean peninsula from imperialist aggressors.

Many Uzbek Koreans from the Chirchiq military academy, together with other Central Asian Koreans, went and fought the Korean War shoulder to shoulder with Kim Il Sung, helping him to liberate North Korea and establish the DPRK.

Most of these Koreans stayed in North Korea afterwards as war heroes and Kim Il Sung’s closest friends and allies.

They became generals, marshals and admirals in the DPRK’s newly built military apparatus. Alexey Ten was among them – he also became a general and the DPRK’s deputy minister of defense.

Recognition at last

Konstantin, Nikolay’s father, must have finally felt very happy for his brother – at last, he was in a very high and powerful position in the country that seemed to highly appreciate him.

Earlier and while still living in Uzbekistan, Alexey Ten got married and had his first son Leonid, whom all of his brother’s family felt especially close to.

Later, after Alexey had fought together with Kim Il Sung in the Korean War and while his family already lived in North Korea, Alexey’s wife got badly ill with appendicitis. She was operated across the border from North Korea in the city of Harbin, but unluckily didn’t survive.

Alexey eventually remarried with a North Korean woman and had several more children with her, and his first son Leonid kept living with them.

After the direct request from the Comrade Kim Il Sung, he and many other Uzbek Korean war heroes surrendered their Soviet citizenship in exchange for the North Korean one. The DPRK seemed to euphorically claim them back.

During this time, there was a unique exchange of letters going on between Upper Chirchiq in Uzbekistan and Pyongyang in North Korea, with the help of North Korean Embassy in Moscow.

Konstantin, Nikolay’s father, would write to his brother Alexey or his nephew Leonid, always in Korean, and send his letters to the DPRK’s Moscow embassy that would then pass them directly to the general Chon Il Bang (Alexey Ten) in Pyongyang, and vice versa.

Nikolay managed to keep some of the remaining letters, together with the photos of his cousin little Lenya.

A colorful and happy postcard from Pyongyang signed with a trembling hand of the little child in broken Russian, wishing his cousins the best of luck and plenty of health…

The lines in Korean from both brothers and little Lenya, who would always write all first names and some particular words in Russian, as if trying not to forget his original mother language…

The signature of the North Korean ambassador in Moscow, stating that he had indeed passed the letters between the recipients…

Those invisible ties that linked the Uzbek Koreans back to North Korea, they weren’t there to last long. Nor was there to last their short and euphoric success in the DPRK, a historical motherland they were so happy and proud to help rebuilding together.

Recipient Unknown

Since 1954, upon the death of Joseph Stalin and demolition of his personality cult as contradicting to the true principles of Leninism, the relationship between North Korea and the Soviet Union started to deteriorate dramatically.

Kim Il Sung, who adopted the system of adoration and political reprisals from his own beloved Great Leader, felt quite vulnerable after Stalin’s defamation in the USSR and started suspecting the new Soviet command of plotting to destroy him in a direct coup-d-etat.

Among the first ones to blame for the same old sins – political and military treason, espionage and animosity to the DPRK – were the same Soviet Koreans who again and again found themselves between the wheels of ruthless state machinery bound to destroy them.

Cruel purges started one by one against closest friends, former fellows and allies. The DPRK’s highest military apparatus consisting mostly of Soviet Korean ministers, deputy ministers, generals, marshals and admirals was soon and completely eradicated.

It looked like Kim Il Sung was trying to change the past and make it seem as if the years between the 1940s and 1960s had never existed. He did everything possible to wipe out the entire memory of the traitors who had given him and their historical motherland everything, up to their own lives.

Suddenly, Konstantin’s letters started returning from the Moscow based North Korean embassy with a weird stamp ‘ R ecipient unknown’.

Alexey’s postal address simply ceased to exist. Nobody could explain anything. Konstantin kept sending letters, and the letters kept coming back with the same postal stamp, recipient unknown.

It lasted so until Konstantin, exhausted and anguished, managed to talk directly to the North Korean ambassador in Moscow, who finally explained him everything.

‘Don’t look for your brother any longer. Stop sending him those letters. There is no way to find him or his family now. They have been purged as traitors, spies and enemies of the state, and we know nothing about them at this point. And, probably, we will never know.’

Post scriptum

How many cycles of repression can one survive? How many tears can one cry day and night? How many family members can one loose? And the most important question – what for and whose fault is it that such atrocities keep happen?

The Soviet Koreans, Uzbek Koreans, Koreans kept spinning again and again crushed between the wheels of history, betrayed and dishonored again and again by a foreign motherland…

How many motherlands can one loose and how many of them can one get?

And what is it worth, after all, when at the end everything you are bound to have is stay homeless, become forgotten and dishonored..? Or simply die..? Nikolay’s parents could never answer those questions. Have they ever asked them at all?

Nikolay answers my question this time. ‘Have they ever blamed Joseph Stalin or the Soviet state for what it had done to them? Maybe, they did. Probably so. I don’t really know, because they were never free to talk about it, even with us. I don’t blame anyone any longer. I simply hope such atrocities will never happen again.’

92,How American Express leverages ML to achieve lowest card fraud rates in the world,"By

In such a situation, advanced techniques in machine learning and deep learning are essential, and the company uses them extensively in detecting and preventing frauds. But how does Amex do that on such a large scale?

To understand better, Analytics India Magazine reached out to Dr Manish Gupta, Vice President, Machine Learning & Data Science Research, and Head of Risk COE Bangalore at American Express.

According to Dr Gupta, Amex has built and deployed best in class ML models, leveraging state-of-the-art technologies like deep learning, machine learning for various business decision-making processes.

How would you define your leadership role at American Express in terms of the initiatives you are driving?

Dr Gupta: I lead the machine learning and data science team that builds state-of-the-art machine learning solution frameworks and leverages them in risk and analytics decisions on behalf of our customers across the globe.

How did the journey of Amex in machine learning begin?

Dr Gupta: When it comes to American Express, early on, our leadership recognised the value of big data analytics and data to drive better decision-making and ultimately support risk management. As a 170-year old company, it has instilled a culture that embraces innovation, combining its technology and infrastructure with new computing techniques to make better and faster decisions.

This mindset is a critical advantage to American Express since it began its work in machine learning nearly 10 years ago. We have recently started to explore deep learning techniques to generate the next set of data innovations by deriving intelligence from the global, integrated network of American Express.

We are challenging ourselves to leverage deep learning capabilities to bring human-level intuition from this structured data. Deep learning has helped us to improve credit and fraud decisions and elevate the payment experience for millions of Card Members across the globe.

How does American Express use machine learning to maintain a competitive edge? Can you elaborate with a few examples?

Dr Gupta: American Express has three unique advantages: its data, advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, and decision science talent. American Express has deployed what we believe to be one of the most advanced machine learning systems in the financial services industry.

Our machine learning algorithms across credit and fraud risk are used to monitor in real-time more than $1.2 trillion worth of transactions annually around the world. We use sophisticated tools and methods to evaluate data available only to American Express since we operate as a card issuer, merchant acquirer and a network.

As a result of deploying machine learning within our fraud models back in 2014, we have continued to maintain the lowest fraud rates in the credit card industry (half that of our competitors), according to the February 2020 Nilson Report. Having our card members backs is our top priority and keeping our fraud rates low is key to achieving this goal.

Please tell us about the deep learning approach at Amex to counter fraudulent transactions. Can you discuss some brief details about data science techniques you use to create fraud analytics solutions?

Dr Gupta: We have been leveraging advanced embedding techniques and deep learning generative and sequential models to better train our models to identify genuine transaction patterns from fraudulent ones, which has led to a significant drop in fraud losses and improvements in customer experience. We have recently invested in high-performance deep learning infrastructure based on the GPUs to implement real-time inferencing frameworks.

How do you test your models to simulate real-time frauds?

Dr Gupta: Our models are real-time, allowing us to be proactive about fraud prevention. Each incoming transaction is evaluated for its propensity of being fraudulent so that we can stop it before any losses are incurred. Our state-of-the-art decision engines help in evaluating models using complex feature calculations in a few milliseconds.

What according to you is the most significant breakthrough in AI/ML in the last five years, and why?

Dr Gupta: I’ll give you my top three. First, we have the Deep Learning Frameworks such as Tensorflow, Pytorch etc., which helped democratise AI rapidly. Now, people can build AI models very easily. Second, there are GPUs that make AI economical: One of the big reasons AI is now such a big deal is because of the cost of crunching, so much data has become affordable. Finally, there are Neural Architectures such as BERT, ResNet etc. has accelerated the innovation in NLP and Computer Vision Domains.",0
16,Treasury Department pushes back on claim Mnuchin is politicizing Postal Service,"The Treasury Department has released a ""fact sheet"" to refute claims made by former U.S. Postal Service official David Williams that the Treasury Department and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are politicizing the Postal Service and inappropriately interfering with its work.

The department's rebuttal was issued in a press release, in response to testimony by former USPS Board of Governors Vice Chairman David Williams. He told the Congressional Progressive Caucus Thursday that he had resigned from the board ""when it became clear to me that the administration was politicizing the Postal Service."" He claimed that Mnuchin was the ""lead figure for the White House in that effort.""

By statute, Mnuchin as treasury secretary is responsible for providing the Postal Service with a line of credit, Williams testified. But Mnuchin ""was using that responsibility to make demands that I believed would turn the Postal Service into a political tool, ending its long history as an apolitical public infrastructure,"" Williams said.

On Friday, the Postal Service Board of Governors also announced it is establishing a bipartisan Election Mail Committee to oversee the Postal Service's support of the mail-in voting process. The committee will be led by Governor Lee Moak, joined by Governor Ron Bloom and Governor John Barger.

The Treasury Department denied in the release that it used its role as lender to USPS to make political demands and said it was false that Republican appointees to the USPS Board of Governors and the Postal Regulatory Commission visit Mnuchin to ""kiss the ring,"" as Williams testified.

The Treasury Department also insisted it does not want to privatize USPS, and did not interfere with the Board of Governors' selection of DeJoy as postmaster general.

""In 2018, Secretary Mnuchin was appointed Chair of the Task Force on the United States Postal System (task force) which evaluated potential options for reforming the USPS and concluded the USPS should not be privatized,"" the release read, adding that the task force concluded ""maintaining critical infrastructure as a national resource should be considered the primary business objective under the USPS under a new business model.""

The Trump administration has come under fire for decommissioning Postal Service equipment ahead of a critical election. Mr. Trump admitted to Fox News that he didn't want to provide more funds to the Postal Service because that could allow for mass mail-in voting, which he opposes. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who testified before Congress Friday, has said he would delay the cost-cutting measures to the Post Office until after the election, but he has not committed to replacing infrastructure that was removed.

Dejoy, a major Republican donor and close ally of President Trump, appeared before the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to answer questions about the mail agency's finances and operations during the coronavirus pandemic. Dejoy said the Postal Service is ""fully capable of delivering the nation's election mail securely and on time.""",0
575,Factbox: Iranian influence and presence in Syria,"Iranian militias recruitment

Local Militias

Iran encouraged the Shia minority in Syria to form special militias and recruited Sunnis—especially clans—in the provinces of Aleppo, Raqqa, and Deir ez-Zor. In addition, some of the Shia militias in Syria were and continue to be recruited on a sectarian basis under the pretext of defending places considered holy by the Shia community. For example, campaigns are being conducted in the areas housing holy Shia shrines in Damascus in the Sayeda Zeinab district.

After individuals are recruited, they are sent for about twenty-one to forty-five days of light and medium arms training and sometimes for six months for heavy weapons training. The Syrian militias backed or formed by Iran are divided into several groups.

National Defense Forces: The formation of the National Defense Forces (NDF) began in 2012 with Iranian guidance and support in the city of Homs. It included members of all sects—Sunnis, Alawites, and Druze—and has headquarters in each province. The NDF was considered the largest Syrian militia in terms of number and outreach, with an estimated forty thousand fighters. Iran demanded that the Syrian regime legitimize these forces like the Shia Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq and integrate them into the Assad regime’s military. In 2016, the regime dismantled the NDF, which forced Iran to fully neglect the militia and focus more on the LDF. It’s worth noting that the Russians started communicating with the NDF in late 2018 in order to integrate them with the Fifth Corp, so as to bring militias and ex-Free Syrian Army into Assad’s military to fight on the battlefronts of Hama, Daraa, and Homs.

Local Defense Forces: Iran recruited fighters from the provinces of Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor, and Raqqa under the name of the Local Defense Forces (LDF). The LDF are considered part of the Syrian army and have over fifty thousand fighters. The most prominent militias within the framework are considered to be the Nayrab Brigades (Special Operations), al-Sefira Corps, al-Baqir Brigade, the Nubul and Zahra Brigades, and the Qatraji forces.
Syrian Shia militias: Iran recruited from the Shia minority in Syria; mainly from northern Aleppo, northern Homs, and parts of Raqqa. The Syrian Shia militias have an estimated five thousand to eight thousand fighters. The most prominent of these militias include: the Aleppo branch of the Imam al-Hajjah, the Mahdi soldiers and the Mahdi Army in Nubul and Zahra, the Damascus branch of the Rukia Brigade, the Idlib branch of the al-Waed al-Sadiq Corps, the Homs branch of the forces of Imam Reza, Zin El Abidin Brigade, the Deir ez-Zor branch of the Brigade 313 Busra al-Sham in Daraa, and Al-Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi Brigade (Lattakia and Hama), among others.

Foreign Militias

Iran uses several mechanisms to recruit foreign fighters. It employs the ideological factor through its own “Husseiniat Scouts” to recruit Shia volunteers under the motto of “Protecting Shia shrines.”

Iran also lures fighters to Syria with salaries. For example, every fighter in the Fatemiyoun brigade is given anywhere from $450 to $700 monthly, which makes the militia the highest paid by Iran. For other militias, Iran pays salaries between $200 to $300 and, for local militias, such as Nubl and Zahra Brigades, it gives less than $100 month. The militia salaries are funded from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) budget of approximately $7.6 billion.

The IRGC and Hezbollah typically train members of these militias in camps in Mashhad, northeastern Iran and then transfer them to Syria either by land through Iraq or by air. When they aren’t sent to Iran, the IRGC can rely on several military bases and camps inside Syria, such as Damascus International Airport, al-Tayfour Airport, Azraa Base, Sayeda Zeinab Base, al-Kaswa Camp, Zabadani Camp, and al-Qusayr Camp.

Iraqi militias: Iraqi Shia militias began to appear in Syria at the end of 2012, after Iran directed them to support the Assad regime. Of note are the Zulfiqar Brigade, Abu al-Fadl Abbas Brigade, Asaad Allah al-Ghalib Brigade, the Imam Ali Brigade, and Asayeb Ahl al-Haq Brigade. However, a number of these militias were forced to return to Iraq in mid-2014 to counter the expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), following its takeover of the city of Mosul.
Afghan militias: The IRGC recruited Afghan Shia in Iran and Afghanistan and formed the Fatemiyoun Brigade, which began to appear in Syria in November 2012. The brigade has an estimated three thousand to fourteen thousand fighters spread between three battalions in Damascus, Aleppo, and Hama provinces. Some of the leaders of the Fatemiyoun Brigade fought in the Abu Thar Brigade during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war and the Army of Muhammad during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan war.
Pakistani militias: The IRGC recruited Pakistani Shias and formed the Zaynibion Brigade, which began to appear publicly in Syria in early 2013. The brigade has an estimated one thousand to five thousand fighters deployed in Damascus, Aleppo, Daraa, and Hama provinces.
Lebanese militias: Hezbollah intervened early in the Syrian crisis in May 2011. The Lebanese militant group provided training and technical support to security forces and the Syrian army. Hezbollah has also launched field combat missions since 2013 and has an estimated five thousand to eight thousand fighters in Syria.

Syrian private security companies affiliated with Iran

Before May 2013, the activities of private security companies in Syria were limited to securing shopping malls, banks, and concerts. The growing need for legal armed forces not bound by government regulation led to the issuance of Legislative Decree No. 55: a legal contract that allows militias to operate in Syria and use military force—depending on their contract—thereby allowing these entities to operate freely without needing to report to Assad’s army or security branches.

Iran used private security companies to insert Iranian influence in sensitive Syrian areas, such as the capital, Damascus, without concerns about maintaining this presence in the future, because private security companies are under the guise of a registered Syrian company. Iran found private security to be an ideal way to maintain a presence in strategic locations, like the Baghdad-Damascus highway in the eastern desert of Syria.

Iranian influence and presence beyond the military and security

The Syrian opposition forces’ gains between 2014-2015 was one of Iran’s most important triggers to strengthen its military presence and direct involvement in Syria. Map 2 shows the reality of the current territorial control and influence of Iran, as well as on its local and foreign militias.

As for the Iran-backed foreign militias, the IRGC used a completely different tactic in 2018 to mitigate the risk of Israeli airstrikes. First, it reduced the activity of these militias and used local brokers to work on their behalf, such as the Iraqi Badr Brigade. The militia still maintains three bases in southern Aleppo and near Aleppo international airport. It’s worth noting that all its social media accounts stopped posting about their activity in the area and have since worked under the umbrella of the Syrian LDF.

As the map shows, Iran’s plan was to spread in almost all parts of Syria using a combination of local and foreign militias. The following table explains the actual military strength and involvement of Iran and its allies in Syria in 2020.

The aforementioned Iranian control is no longer limited to military and security presence. Iran’s focus continues to be infiltrating Syrian society and strengthening its presence in the Syrian economic system in order to ensure its survival in Syria—especially in the event that an international agreement is made to neutralize its military presence. The following figures show Iran’s influence and the extent of its military, security, social, and economic control in various Syrian provinces. For example, when it comes to economic control, Iran reactivated the Syrian-Iranian Business Forum in 2018, which played a fundamental role in the spread of Iranian projects in various areas in Syria, mostly focusing on power generation projects.

Iran also works with charitable organizations to better integrate into Syrian society. One of the most significant Iran-backed organizations is Jihad Al-Bina Organization, which focuses mostly on the issue of restoring schools and health centers. The organization is currently active in Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo provinces.

Iran has also recently focused on education outreach, with the number of constructed educational facilities now up to seven, in addition to Iranian cultural centers, which play an important role in spreading Iranian culture in Syrian society. In 2019, Jihad Al-Bina restored sixteen schools in Deir ez-Zor alone. Each had a placard confirming that Iran had supported the operation. Jihad Al-Bina periodically distributes food aid to civilians in an effort to gain loyalty from the local population. During the coronavirus pandemic, Iran established several small medical points in Deir ez-Zor to supply civilians with Vitamin C and surgical masks. Though a minute gesture, many civilians saw the aid as a big deal, while some even saw it as a sign that Iran would never abandon them.

The spread of Iran’s influence in Syria is working accordingly, though not in a fast or clear-cut way. Iran is in Syria for the long term and is taking the time it needs to get results.",0

Big war on graft cases

Kenya has been fighting a big war on graft cases with the vice being seen as the root of the country's slow development.

Speaking on the wicked edition with Dr King'ori on NTV, Lumumba who served as the director of Ethic and Anti-Corruption Commission from September 2010 to August 2011, said Uhuru and anti-graft agencies were ""robust"" in trying to eradicate corruption in Kenya.

""Since President Kenyatta came in to power, there is a sense in which he does not appear to interfere in the prosecution of suspects. When you see the robustness on which the EACC, DPP and the DCI are operating it tells you that the one thing - political goodwill that was missing in the old days is beginning to improve for the better,"" said Lumumba.

The eloquent public speaker urged the agencies mandated to fight graft to seize the moment to ensure corruption ends.

""Hong Kong was one of the most corrupt places in the world in the 1900s. The administration there took a decision that we are going to change this country...the same applies to Singapore when it parted ways with Malaysia. Tanzania's John Magufuli and Rwanda's Kagame have also reduced the vice,"" he added.

As was earlier reported by TUKO.co.ke, Uhuru's war on corruption had averted loss of KSh 120 billion according to EACC.

The agency's chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak acknowledged the recovery of stolen funds had been accelerated in the past two years in the wake of Uhuru's heightened war on graft.",0
198,COVID-19: Mahan Air offers to repatriate all Indians in Iran,"COVID-19: Mahan Air offers to repatriate all Indians in Iran

New Delhi, March 15 (IANS) Amidst the coronavirus crisis and the government''s efforts to bring bank Indians from the severely affected countries, Tehran-based Mahan Air on Sunday offered to bring all Indians stranded in Iran back to their homeland without ""any commercial interest"".

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the airline''s MD Hamid Arabnejad said that around 7,000 Indian nationals have been stranded across various locations in Iran.

""In this regard, I, on behalf of Mahan Air, hereby, offer to safely repatriate all India nationals stranded in Iran back to their country without any commercial interest as a humanitarian initiative for our Indian brethren,"" he said in the letter dated March 15.

He added that there are many stranded Indians who are either students or pilgrims and do not have sufficient means to make alternative arrangements.

Assuring that the Mahan Air will deploy appropriate aircraft to ferry the stranded Indians and land at suitable designated international airport in India, the MD, urged the government of India to grant the required permissions.

The letter mentioned that the Directorate General of Civial Aviation (DGCA) has suspended operations of Iranian carriers to India du to health safety reasons and the airline duly abides by the norms, but noted that the suspension of operations has Indian stranded in Iran.

The letter to PM Modi said that as so many people are in distress and ""your government and our government is making appropriate efforts to evacuate its nationals as many Iranian nationals are also currently stranded in India too.""

""At the same time I have learnt that Indian carriers are hesitant to evacuate the stranded Indian from Iran due to illegal and unwanted sanctions imposed by USA. My learned brother from India, Imran Reza Ansari, former minister, Jammu &amp; Kashmir along with several Indian residents here have been constantly following up and seeking my help.""

The airline already flew back two hundred and thirty-four Indians from Iran and the flight landed at the Jaisalmer on Sunday morning.

""A total of 234 Indians stranded in Iran have arrived in India; including 131 students and 103 pilgrims. Thank you Ambassador Dhamu Gaddam and @India_in_Iran team for your efforts. Thank Iranian authorities,"" External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar tweeted.

The Minister said that the batch comprises 131 students and 103 pilgrims.This is the third batch of Indians evacuated from Iran. A second batch of 44 Indian pilgrims had arrived from Iran on Friday. The first batch of 58 Indian pilgrims were brought back from Iran on Tuesday.

Iran is one of the worst COVID-19-hit countries from where Indian government has been trying to evacuate Indians.

101,Trieste: Italy returns cultural venue to Slovenian community 100 years after fascist arson,"Italy today handed over an ex-Slovenian cultural hub — a hundred years to the day it was burned down by fascists.

The gesture, carried out in Trieste, is aimed at healing wounds with ethnic Slovenians in the north-eastern city.

Italy annexed Trieste from the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of World War I, when Slovenian speakers made up around 25% of the city's population.

Then, on July 13, 1920, Italian fascists burned down the city's cultural centre, known as Narodni Dom in Slovenian, in retaliation for the killing of two Italian soldiers in Split, now part of Croatia, by Yugoslavian nationalists.

A century on, Italian President Sergio Mattarella signed the building over to the Slovenian community on Monday (July 13).

He said the handover marked the ""start of a new chapter in the shared future of Italians and Slovenians, in the European spirit of mutual respect, cooperation and coexistence"".

""I know that feelings of division and pain are still strong,"" he added. ""But nevertheless, I am convinced that the desire for harmony and friendship is even stronger.""

His counterpart, Slovenian President Borut Pahor, described it as a ""dream come true as if all the stars had aligned after a hundred years"".

""But they [the stars] did not do it alone - it was us who did it,"" he added.

The arson represented a huge loss for Trieste's Slovenian community.

It was one of Europe's most modern buildings at the time, with a 400-seat theatre hall and a glass rooftop that could be opened in summer. It also had a gym, a bank, a music school, as well as restaurants and cafes, a hotel and private apartments.

The building was restored and later became a hotel.

In the years that followed WWII and the fall of the Fascist regime, the Slovenian community asked Italian authorities several times to have the building host activities for them again.

""At the beginning of the 20th century, Italy's liberal party, which had a majority in Trieste, did not want to open Slovenian schools in the city centre and restricted the cultural, political and demographic presence of the Slovenians, who used to be over a quarter of Trieste's population,"" said Marta Verginella, a historian at the University of Ljubljana

This kind of attitude, she told Euronews, remained during the Fascist regime and also throughout the history of the Italian republic.

In January 2020, president Mattarella and president Pahor finally announced the handover would take place in July, exactly 100 years after the arson.

The Narodni Dom currently hosts a branch of the University of Trieste and a library with over 43,000 books.

Following the handover, the building will be owned by an organisation constituted by two Slovenian minority associations, the Slovenian Economic and Cultural Union (SKGZ) and the Confederation of the Slovenian Organisations (SSO).",0
143,The man who would be king,"God's Fury, England's Fire: A New History of the English Civil Wars
758pp, Allen Lane, £30

The English civil war is the great defining event of British history. With the exception of the Norman conquest, no other occurrence produced so spectacular an upheaval or left so enduring a legacy in the national memory. By comparison with the devastation caused in Europe by the thirty years' war, which was happening at the same time, England escaped relatively lightly. But a huge amount of destruction took place, some hideous atrocities were committed and a larger proportion of the population may have died than in the first world war.

Even more traumatic than the fighting itself was the social and political revolution that accompanied it. The defeat of Charles I led eventually to the trial and execution of the king, the abolition of the monarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican church, and the expropriation of hundreds of royalist landowners. There was a ferment of ideas, reflected in an unprecedented outpouring of tracts and pamphlets. Between 1640 and 1660 the bookseller George Thomason collected some 20,000 of them. Now in the British Library, they offer an unparalleled insight into the mental life of the time and the host of radical schemes put forward for the reform of religion, government and society. In 1660, the restoration of Charles II abruptly closed down this debate. The old order was restored, but the memory of the civil war haunted later centuries and influenced the religious and political affiliations of many subsequent generations.

These dramatic events have not lacked their historians. Even during the 1640s, there was much collecting and publishing of the documents issued by the two sides. Later in the century, Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, who had been a key figure in the royalist party, wrote his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars, which is acknowledged as one of the greatest works of English historiography. In the 19th century, two academic giants, SR Gardiner and CH Firth, produced near-definitive narratives of the period; and in the middle of the 20th century, the sharpest historical talents of the age, including RH Tawney, Christopher Hill, Lawrence Stone and HR Trevor-Roper, conducted a ferocious debate about the long-term causes of the war. Was it a bourgeois revolution? Or the last throw of an economically declining gentry class? Or a war of religion?

The later 20th century saw a reaction against the notion that the war had any long-term causes. Led by Conrad Russell, historians now preferred to regard it as a political accident, provoked by misplaced fears of ""popery"" and a general atmosphere of distrust. They focused their attention on events in parliament and were relatively indifferent to opinion outside Westminster. More recently, the pendulum has swung again. The reality of deep political and religious disagreements within the nation is generally accepted; and an infinity of microscopic local studies has revealed the extreme complexity of local allegiances. In addition, the belated awareness that the war began with the revolt of the Scottish Covenanters and culminated in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland has meant that many historians now prefer to speak not of the English civil war, but of the ""war of three kingdoms"". This was the perspective adopted in the late Austin Woolrych's fine survey of six years ago, Britain in Revolution, 1625-1660

In his new history, covering the years between the Covenanters' revolt in 1637 and the execution of Charles I in 1649, Michael Braddick concentrates upon the distinctively English experience, rather than the British one, arguing very reasonably that, though the war has to be understood in a British context, it was in England that there emerged the ""most radical and creative politics"", as the contending parties appealed to the people and enlisted them in the debate in a way unprecedented in early modern Europe. He makes much use of the Thomason tracts and shows how pamphlets containing serious political statements alternated with rumours of plots and counter-plots. Radical schemes for the reform of religion, government and society competed for attention with tales of witches, monstrous births and armies in the sky.

Braddick's book is an admirably judicious synthesis of the huge volume of work carried out in recent years by scores of professional historians, to which his end notes and bibliography provide an excellent guide. (Unfortunately, John Adamson's The Noble Revolt, an outstandingly original study of the events leading up to the war, published last year, came too late to be fully taken into account.) Curiously, the result is a narrative of the period with which Christopher Hill, writing 50 years ago, would have found little to quarrel. But whereas Hill, like most historians of his day, was not very interested in battles, Braddick also gives us a helpful analysis of the course of the war itself. He stresses that parliament's victory was far from inevitable and he does not spare us the horrors. When in 1643 a Kentish blacksmith led a party to pillage the houses of the rich, he was told that it was only Roundheads whom they should plunder. In that case, he retorted, ""we will make every man a Roundhead that hath anything to lose."" The surgeon Richard Wiseman, whose Treatise of Wounds drew on his experiences with the royalist army, made a diagnostic distinction between those who died howling like dogs, and those who died screaming.

It is not easy to summarise the complicated events of these years, even in a book of 700 pages. SR Gardiner needed more than six volumes, and much more has been found out since then. The political manoeuvring which followed the military defeat of the king in 1646 was particularly tortuous. The victors in the conflict - parliament, the army, the Scots and the London radicals - fell out with each other and Charles exploited their disunity in a complex series of disingenuous negotiations. Braddick's readers will have to work hard to follow the story at this point. But they will not fail to appreciate just how non-inevitable the king's execution was. As late as the winter of 1647-48, Charles was happily scrutinising plans for a huge new royal palace at Whitehall, intended to be twice the size of the Spanish Escorial; and even when his trial began in January 1649 the outcome was far from certain.

For Braddick, one vital feature of the period is that it generated ideas in politics, religion and natural philosophy that foreshadow the 18th-century Enlightenment. It was, he says, a time of ""creative chaos"". Indeed chaos and confusion dominate his story. The two sides in the war, he tells us, ""consisted of complex coalitions of allies, with varying concerns and differing degrees of conviction and commitment"". The Thomason tracts reveal a babble of discordant voices and conflicting viewpoints.

The moral he draws is disconcertingly postmodernist. After his long, carefully grounded, empirically based narrative, Braddick in his final paragraphs abruptly dissociates himself from the ""hubristic pomp"" of professional historians who seek a definitive account of the period. Instead he plumps for indeterminacy. ""Experiences of these conflicts,"" he declares, ""were plural, ambiguous, divided and contrasting; their potential meanings equally diverse."" They deserve to be remembered, he tells us in one truly awful concluding sentence, ""not for a single voice or consequence, but because they provide many knowledges for our discourse"". His impressive book deserves a less murky conclusion. Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic is published by Penguin.",0
151,F5 Networks intros new fraud detection engine based on Shape Security acquisition,"F5 Networks on Tuesday introduced Shape AI Fraud Engine (SAFE), a new SaaS offering that promises to eliminate fraudulent online transactions that can sometimes bypass other security and fraud detection controls.

Leveraging technology from its $1 billion acquisition of Shape Security earlier this year, F5's SAFE service evaluates online transactions via AI in order to understand user intent and block potential fraud before it occurs. The product marks F5's first real push into the fraud market since acquiring Shape Security, the company said.

Following its acquisition of Shape Security, F5 has integrated Shape's capabilities into its portfolio of application security services, with F5 serving as a traffic flow insertion point for Shape's online fraud and abuse prevention solutions. F5's app security services specialize in protecting applications across multi-cloud environments.

""The need for innovation in fraud prevention becomes more urgent when you factor in the accelerated shift to online channels driven by the current global health situation,"" said Sumit Agarwal, VP of analytic products at F5, and co-founder of Shape. ""We're seeing
fraudsters launch increasingly sophisticated attacks that take advantage of COVID-driven shifts and overall economic distress.""

Earlier this year F5 announced series of new multi-cloud application security services, including a service that brought its Web Application Firewall (WAF) technology to the NGINX platform stemming from the company's acquisition of NGINX.

The acquisitions of Shape Security and NGINX and recent product launches have allowed F5 to reframe its approach to security with a focus on four key areas: application layer security, trusted application access, application infrastructure security and intelligent threat services. The Shape AI Fraud Engine fits into this approach and gives F5 an entry point into the fraud prevention market. The service is available now.",0

Jump to navigation Jump to search

Arayik Vladimiri Harutyunyan (Armenian: Արայիկ Վլադիմիրի Հարությունյան; born 14 December 1973) is the incumbent President of Artsakh. He was formerly the State Minister and Prime Minister of the Republic of Artsakh. He was the last Prime Minister of the country before the office of Prime Minister was abolished in 2017.

Early life

Harutyunyan was born in Stepanakert, the capital of the Republic, in 1973. He attended Yerevan State Institute of Economy in 1990 and two years after, in 1992, joined the self-defence forces of Nagorno-Karabakh and took part in Nagorno-Karabakh War. After the war, he moved from Yerevan State Institute of Economy to Artsakh State University Faculty of Economics and graduated in 1995. Three years later, in 1998, he finished his post-graduate course at Artsakh State University. [1]

Career

Harutyunyan started his career at the Ministry of Finance and Economy of Artsakh in 1994, serving as Assistant to the Minister. In 1997, he left the ministry and started his career in the private sector, in Armagrobank, working there until 2004.

In National Assembly

Harutyunyan co-founded the Free Motherland party in 2005 which took part in the 2005 parliamentary election, winning 10 out of 33 seats in the National Assembly. He also served as the Chairman of Free Motherland and the Free Motherland faction in the National Assembly. Harutyunyan headed the Commission on Financial, Budget and Economy Management in National Assembly. [2]

Premiership

In 2007, he was appointed Prime Minister by then- President Bako Sahakyan. His first speech as Prime Minister was full of promises to revive the economy, democracy and social justice in the unrecognised country. The urgent steps that he promised to take included ‘fighting against corruption, protectionism, the clan system and social evils'. [3] After 2017 constitutional referendum, Artsakh was transformed from semi-presidential system into a presidential system and the office of the Prime Minister was abolished. Harutyunyan remained in the Sahakyan government and was appointed as State Minister. [4]

Presidency

He participated in and won the 2020 Artsakhian general election, thereby becoming the 4th President of Artsakh. [5] [6] He was inaugurated on 21 May [7] in a ceremony that was attended by his opponent Masis Mayilyan and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. [8] [9] During the ceremony, which was held in Shusha instead of Stepanakert (a decision which angered the authorities in Baku), [10] he described Artsakh and Armenia as “inseparable parts of a united national homeland”. [11] During the first week of his presidency, he signed two highly publicized executive orders: The first one changed the seat of the National Assembly of Artsakh from Stepanakert to Shushi, while the second made all tertiary education in Artsakh free. On September 19, he announced that the National Assembly will be moved from the capital to Shushi by in 2022, in time for the 30th anniversary of the Capture of Shusha. [12]

2020 conflict

During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan claimed that the Azerbaijani Army had severely wounded Harutyunyan, who had visited the front that morning. [13] [14] These allegations were denied by both Harutyunyan and his government. [15] On 23 October, Harutyunyan published an open letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin penned by himself, calling for Russian support to Artsakh, noting the many Russian and Soviet figures from the region, including nobles Valerian Madatov and Mikayel Loris-Melikov, the five ethnic Armenian Marshals of the Soviet Union (Ivan Bagramyan, Ivan Isakov, Hamazasp Babadzhanian Sergei Khudyakov, and Sergei Aganov) as well as politicians Anastas Mikoyan and Ivan Tevosyan. [16] On 27 October, he dismissed Jalal Harutyunyan from the post of Minister of Defence after he was wounded in fighting. [17] It came a week after he promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant general [18] [19] and a day later Harutyunyan granted him with the title of Hero of Artsakh. [20]

Honours and awards

Awarded with the medal “For liberation of Shushi” and decorated with the order “Martial Cross” 2nd degree.
By the decree of the NKR President dated August 30, 2016 Harutyunyan was decorated with the order “ Grigor Lusavorich ” for his services rendered to the Nagorno Karabakh Republic and on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the proclamation of NKR.

222,Singapore tightens AML rules around cryptoassets,"Plans to update existing payment services laws in the city state, set out before Singapore's parliament earlier this month, would bring 'virtual asset service providers' (VASPs) that are not existing regulated financial institutions within the scope of anti-money laundering (AML) requirements for the first time in the country. They would also implement international standards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in June 2019.

Under the proposed changes, VASPs would be considered to be businesses involved in the transfer of ""digital payment tokens"" (DPTs), the provision of custodian wallet services for DPTs, or in facilitating the exchange of DPTs without possession of moneys or DPTs by the DPT service provider. VASPs would need to obtain a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the body which regulates the provision of payment services in Singapore, to operate.

""The speed, anonymity and cross-border nature of VASP activities make them inherently more vulnerable to [money laundering or terrorist financing] risks,"" according to an explanatory brief published by MAS.

Nathanael Lim of Pinsent Masons MPillay, the Singapore joint law venture between MPillay and Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law, said: ""The amendments show the MAS’ continued emphasis for payment service providers to properly manage their AML and CFT (combatting the financing of terrorism) risks. DPT service providers will need to invest in a proper set-up to ensure that these standards are met.""

The new Payment Services (Amendment) Bill, as currently drafted, would also provide MAS with new powers to adapt to the changing nature of risk relating to DPTs in future. MAS would be able to ""impose user protection measures on certain DPT service providers to ensure the safekeeping of customer assets held by the DPT service provider, where necessary; and measures on certain DPT service providers where it is in MAS’ view necessary or expedient in the interest of the public or a section of the public, the stability of the financial system in Singapore, or the monetary policy of MAS"", according to its briefing.

Further new provisions included in the Bill aim to address cross-border risk involving money transfers.

""The Bill will broaden the definition of cross-border money transfer service to cover a service provider that actively facilitates cross-border money transfers between entities in different countries although moneys are not accepted or received in Singapore,"" MAS said. ""This is in view of the ML/TF and reputational risks that such activities may present, similar to services that are already regulated under the PS Act. A cross-border money transfer service provider which carries on a business in Singapore of providing such services will need to be licensed and subject to MAS’ AML/CFT regulations.""

476,"Letter by President Charles Michel to the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella","I am writing to you at a time of serious crisis for Italy and Europe. A crisis in which fate has assigned to your country the difficult, dramatic role of being on the front line in the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent.

First of all, I would like to offer to you, who represent the unity and national feeling of a great country that is the founder of the European integration project, my deepest condolences for the enormous toll of victims of this almost unprecedented threat to our societies.

At the same time, I feel I must address to all of Italy not only my own admiration, but also that of the members of the European Council that I have the honour to preside over, for the incredible efforts of the Italian health personnel, who have been working non-stop in emergency conditions for weeks now, and for the tireless work of the Civil Protection. We observe with emotion and respect the pioneering role of the Italian authorities in managing the response, with timely, extensive and socially significant measures to contain the spread of the infection. At a time when some may have underestimated the extent of the threat, Italy has shown an unflinching sense of foresight, unity and resilience. Italy's response has constituted, and constitutes, a model for many countries, not only in Europe, which are forced, with a delay of only a few weeks, to meet the same needs in terms of health and social response.

The European institutions are working with Prime Minister Conte and with the Italian government to coordinate more effective action at the EU level. The impact of this action is not always immediately visible to national public opinion, but we are convinced that they will help us to face the crisis more united, to come out of it as soon as possible, and to manage its inevitable economic and social impact.

It is in this sense that we have taken measures restricting the export of health protection and assistance equipment; the financial crisis support measures announced last night by President Lagarde of the ECB; support for research to rapidly develop an adequate vaccine and medical treatment; the closure of the external borders of the Schengen area; and the efforts, both internally and in third countries, to ensure that all European citizens who wish to return home can do so quickly. Unity and solidarity are the pillars of our Union and any attempts to undermine them will immediately be stopped in their tracks.

The European Council continues to give relentless political impetus and support to this joint action. We will consult again next week, to decide together on further measures and monitor progress.

I should like, through you, Mr President, to offer your citizens a simple and heartfelt message: ITALY IS NOT ALONE.

No country can do it alone in this crisis. No country should do it alone. We must help and support each other.

This is the true essence of European solidarity, and the deep sense of the community of states and the model of cooperation that Italy has so strongly contributed to build.

I know to what extent you share, personally and politically, the attachment to these shared values. And I am convinced that you will continue to interpret them, even at such a difficult time for public opinion, which is concerned about the crisis and the re-emergence of centrifugal forces that are instigated by identity politics.

I would like to renew, to you and through you to the country, the condolences of the European institutions for the tragedy that Italy is experiencing, and condolences to the many victims, their loved ones and all those who are fighting against this pandemic.

Italy and Europe will come out stronger than before.",0
287,Barham Salih,"Barham Salih (Kurdish: بەرھەم ساڵح‎, romanized: Berhem Salih; Arabic: برهم صالح‎; born 12 July 1960) is an Iraqi Kurdish politician who is the eighth and current President of Iraq. [5]

He is the former Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region and a former deputy prime minister of the Iraqi federal government. He was elected and assumed office as the President of Iraq on 2 October 2018.

Early life and education[ edit ]

Salih was born in 1960 in Sulaymaniyah. He was arrested in 1979 by the Ba'athist regime twice on charges of involvement in the Kurdish national movement by taking some photos of protesters in Sulaimaniya city and spent 43 days in detention in a Special Investigation Commission prison in Kirkuk where he was tortured. [6] Once released, he finished high school and left Iraq for the United Kingdom to flee continuous persecution. [6]

Salih is married to Sarbagh Salih, the head and founding member of the Kurdish Botanical Foundation and a women's rights activist. [7] The couple have two children. [8]

Deputy Secretary General of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan[ edit ]

Barham Salih joined the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in late 1976 where he became a member of the PUK department of Europe, and was in charge of PUK foreign relations in London. In addition to the political struggle, he finished his university studies and received a Bachelors degree in Civil Engineering and Construction from the Cardiff University in 1983. He continued to study and obtained a Doctorate degree in Statistics and Computer Applications in Engineering from the University of Liverpool in 1987.

He was elected a member of the PUK leadership at the first party conference when Iraqi Kurdistan was liberated from the Ba'ath Party following the Persian Gulf War. He was assigned the task of heading the PUK Office in the United States.

After the fall of the Ba'athist regime in 2003, he became Deputy Prime Minister in the Interim Iraqi Government in mid-2004, Minister of Planning in the Transitional Government in 2005, and Deputy Prime Minister in the elected Iraqi Government (Nouri al-Maliki 's Cabinet) in charge of the economic portfolio and Head of the Economic Committee. Representing the Iraqi Government, he launched the International Compact with Iraq – an initiative of mutual commitment between Iraq and the international community to help Iraq in meeting its obligations of ""building a prosperous, democratic and federal country, in peace with itself and with the region and the world"".

Salih appeared on The Colbert Report on 10 June 2009, broadcast from Baghdad, and was interviewed by the host. He praised the U.S. military for sending troops into Iraq, and acknowledged that many Kurds desire independence.

Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Region Government[ edit ]

Barham Salih spearheaded the Kurdistani List in the 2009 Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election. The list won 59 of 111 seats. He succeeded Nechervan Idris Barzani as the Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government. His term was marked by turbulence with the rise of an opposition (Movement for Change) to challenge the government while his own party was scrambling to stay together after losing the stronghold city of Sulaymaniyah. He survived the first motion of no confidence in Iraqi Kurdistan following the 2011 Kurdish protests in Iraq. He signed the first major oil contract with Exxon Mobil after drafting and amending a new oil law. [9] He relinquished the post of Prime Minister to Nechervan Idris Barzani on 5 April 2012 as part of a political agreement between the ruling KDP–PUK coalition. [10]

Move to opposition[ edit ]

In September 2017, Salih announced that he was leaving the PUK and forming a new opposition party, the Coalition for Democracy and Justice, to compete in the forthcoming Iraqi Kurdistan elections. Following the death of PUK leader Jalal Talabani and the Kurdish opposition leader Nawshirwan Mustafa, the alliance was seen to have the potential to change the Kurdish political landscape. He said he hoped to gather all the other opposition parties, including Gorran and Komal, to challenge the governing KDP –PUK alliance. [11]

President of Iraq[ edit ]

On 2 October 2018, Barham Salih was elected as 8th President of Iraq. [12] He received 219 votes and defeated Fuad Hussein who secured 22 votes. [13]

Salih condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, stating that it ""will cause untold humanitarian suffering, empower terrorist groups. The world must unite to avert a catastrophe, promote political resolution to the rights of all Syrians, including Kurds, to peace, dignity and security"". [14]

On 24 September 2019, President Salih had his first bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. [15]

On 26 December 2019, Salih submitted a letter of resignation after refusing to appoint Basra Governor Asaad Al Eidani as Prime Minister following the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi, amid ongoing protests across the country. Salih stated that Al Eidani would not be approved by the demonstrators. [16] [17]

Criticism[ edit ]

On 19 September 2018, the announcement that Barham Salih will be the PUK's candidate for the post of Iraqi president was greeted with anger by many on social media while others expressed hope that his international reputation and experience would bring a steady hand to tumultuous Baghdad. Some took to the social media platform to call Salih out for perceived opportunism, noting he had just recently been campaigning against PUK and KDP corruption. [18] [19] [20]

415,India’s capital New Delhi suffers most toxic air in a year,"New Delhi, the capital city with the worst air quality worldwide, suffered its most toxic day in a year on Thursday, recording the concentration of poisonous PM2.5 particles at 14 times the World Health Organization’s safe limit.

A raging coronavirus epidemic, with more than 400,000 confirmed cases in the city of 20 million, has heightened alarm over the health hazard posed by the choking smog, with doctors warning of a sharp increase in respiratory illnesses.

“At this time in Delhi, coronavirus and pollution are causing a major havoc,” Arvind Kejriwal, New Delhi’s chief minister said in a recorded video on Twitter.

“We are seeing all around the sky is covered with smoke, and because of this, the situation from coronavirus is worsening.”

The deadly PM2.5 particles are less than 2.5 microns in diameter, can penetrate the lung barrier and enter the blood system, potentially causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases including lung cancer, according to WHO.

“Woke up with a feeling that poisonous garbage is stuck in my windpipe,” said Rahul Ojha, a resident who tagged government authorities in a tweet, blaming them for inaction.

New Delhi’s air pollution typically worsens in October and November due to farmers burning off stubble in surrounding states, traffic fumes and windless days.

On Thursday, the federal air quality and weather monitoring agency recorded 4,135 incidents of farm fires – the highest of the season. Firecrackers ignited for a Hindu festival on Wednesday added to the problem, some people said.

The average PM2.5 level was 370 per cubic metre of air against the WHO’s prescribed safe limit of 25 per cubic metre.

The overall air quality index (AQI), which includes other pollutants besides PM2.5 particles, crossed 460 on a scale of 500, the worst since November 14, 2019.

If the air quality stays in the severe zone for 48 hours, authorities could bar vehicles entering New Delhi, shut down construction, and stop half the cars owned by residents from being driven on roads through an odd-even scheme.",0
396,UM Air Complains Of Pressure From State Aviation Service,"The Ukrainian-Mediterranean Airlines (UM Air) has complained that the State Aviation Service is exerting pressure on it on behalf of Ukraine International Airlines (UIA), the CFTS portal’s correspondent reports.

""According to protocol, each side is permitted to operate four flights on this route (the Kiev-Tehran route). The Iranian side is not operating flights. We submitted documents for increase of our number of flights on this route. The Ministry of Infrastructure’s commission gave us these flights – two flights per week. At the same time, they refused to allocate flights to UIA because of its debt to the state. However, Mr. Antoniuk (the State Aviation Service’s head Denys Antoniuk) refused to comply with the commission's decision to grant us the additional flights. We have been requesting permission for a second flight since July. The Iranian department has limited the number of flights for UIA, allowing it two flights and allowing us two. The State Aviation Service of Ukraine sent the Iranian authorities a notification stating that it has reallocated the flights and granted three to UIA and one to us,"" UM Air’s Chairman Rodrigue Elias Merhej told reporters.

He added that the intergovernmental agreement between Ukraine and Iran provides for selecting one carrier from each country and granting them the right to perform four flights per week.

""The State Aviation Service decided to select UIA as the second carrier on this route. This fundamentally violates the international agreements between Ukraine and Iran. Firstly, this requires talks to be held with the Iranian side, the relevant amendments to be made to the intergovernmental agreement, and passage through the parliaments of both countries. After that, they become valid,"" he said.

As a result, according to him, UM Air’s Kiev-Tehran flight did not take place on November 17 because of a ban by the State Aviation Service.

However, the State Aviation Service’s head Denys Antoniuk told the Center for Transport Strategies that the UM Air airline company had the right to perform only one flight per week and that it acquired the right to the second flight via corrupt means, which was the reason for the ban.",0

Aleta Planet announced on Friday that the foundation will make donations to various charities, aiming to ""create a positive impact on society at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected many livelihoods"".

It will support the needs of the elderly and children in the local community, with an initial commitment of S$200,000, said the company.

The first of such donations is S$100,000 to the Mediacorp Enable Fund, a community fund administered by SG Enable that aims to help build a society where people with disabilities, including the elderly and children, ""are recognised for their abilities and are able to lead full, socially integrated lives"".

SG Enable chief executive officer Ku Geok Boon said: “We are deeply grateful to Aleta Planet Foundation for their strong spirit of charity and choosing the Mediacorp Enable Fund to make their first donation.

""The generous contribution will provide much-needed financial assistance in meeting the last mile needs of persons with disabilities, as well as to help them fulfil their aspirations in life.”

The Aleta Planet Foundation said that as a donor-advised fund, it will work with non-profit organisation Community Foundation of Singapore to identify existing needs of the elderly and children with disabilities.

This will enable the foundation to connect with suitable charity partners as well as manage the funds it receives.

CEO of the Community Foundation of Singapore Catherine Loh said: “We look forward to closer collaboration with the Aleta Planet Foundation to identify gaps in the community so as to foster more effective giving and amplify the positive impact they have on our society.”

Aleta Planet Foundation said its support for the elderly ""will go particularly towards those abandoned by their families and those having to work despite their frailties"".

It will also focus on children with disabilities and those from low-income families whose parents ""have little means to help them reach their full potential"".

Aleta Planet chairman and group CEO Ryan Gwee said that contributions to the foundation will increase over time ""as part of a sustainable corporate giving culture"".

“As Aleta Planet has reached a level of growth, we feel that it is now fitting for us to give back to the community in which we operate,"" said Mr Gwee.

""This is especially timely amid a pandemic and recession that have created considerable hardship for the most vulnerable groups living on the fringes of our society.”",0
184,"Addressing the event, President Ashraf Ghani announced the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Commission.","The EU Delegation to Afghanistan on Thursday held its sixth annual Anti-Corruption Conference at the Presidential Palace.

The conference gathered around 150 participants from civil society, the private sector, official institutions, media, and the international community.

EU Ambassador Andreas Von Brandt at the event emphasized the importance of strengthening anti-corruption efforts as a measure to build trust between the Afghan people and their government as well as with the international donor community.

“Trust is an equally crucial component to achieve sustainable peace,” he said.

Ambassador von Brandt highlighted the need for a strong regulatory framework, including by developing a robust new Anti-Corruption Strategy, which President Ghani confirmed will be done, through an inclusive process based on lessons learned from the past.

He also emphasized the need for strong independent institutions and in this context welcomed the announcement by the President on the formation of the Anti-Corruption Commission.

To build national consensus on fighting corruption President Ghani also announced the Government’s consideration to call for a Loya Jirga.

President Ghani announced the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Commission and assured that a new anti-corruption strategy will be based on lessons learned and developed through consultations.

The EU ambassador also stressed that further efforts are still needed to implement anti-corruption rules and policies.

He emphasized the need to deliver effective investigations and prosecutions, in particular of high-level suspects, to demonstrate that corrupt actions have consequences.

“Everyone must be equal before the law if Afghanistan wants to build a strong culture of accountability and integrity, he stressed,” he said.

The conference was held two weeks prior to the Afghanistan 2020 Geneva Conference where the international community is expected to make commitments for Afghanistan for another four years.",0
6,"Italian and Romanian judicial authorities, with Eurojust’s support, dismantle major criminal network in financial fraud, cybercrime and money laundering | #cyberfraud | #criminal | #cybercrimnals","The Hague, 7 July 2020

Judicial authorities and police in Italy and Romania, with Eurojust and Europol support dismantled a criminal network responsible for big-scale financial fraud, cybercrime and money laundering. The illicit profits are estimated to over €20 million resulting from the losses suffered by citizens throughout Europe.

12 suspects were arrested today (8 in Italy and 4 in Romania), including the two leaders of the organised criminal group (OCG). 12 house searches took place and several assets were seized, including vehicles, credit cards, jewellery, properties, and a numismatic collection with an overall estimated value of over €1.5 million.

The organised crime group (OCG) dismantled today is one of the most important transnational criminal networks discovered so far in Italy, operating in financial frauds and cyber scams such as purchase of non-existing goods and services, rental fraud (fraud through the advertisement of inexistent properties to rent), computer phishing, clone-sites phishing (impersonating of a company to trigger large transfers to bogus accounts). With these frauds, the criminals were tricking victims across Europe into making wire transfers to Italian bank accounts, owned by entities used as “money mules”. This way the criminals were laundering the criminal proceeds resulted from this the cybercrime activities, estimated to have caused €20 million losses for citizens throughout Europe.

Today’s action day, coordinated by Eurojust, was the result of intensive cooperation between the judicial and law enforcement authorities in both countries.

The investigation was conducted in Italy by the Postal and Telecommunications Police of Genova with the support of the Central Unit of the Postal and Telecommunications Police, under the supervision of the Public Prosecution Office in Genova. In Romania, the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (Central Structure, Valcea and Bistrita-Nasaud Territorial Offices), Public Prosecutions Offices attached to Bucharest Tribunal, Court of Appeal Pitesti and Court of Appeal Cluj executed the coordinated judicial activities.

Several Romanian police units were involved, respectively Dambovita County Police, Services for Combating Organized Crime Valcea and Bistrita-Nasaud, Service for Criminal Investigations Valcea.

Eurojust played a key role in the judicial cooperation by facilitating the exchange of real-time information between the involved judicial authorities, and providing support in order to plan the operational activity carried out today. During the joint action day, Eurojust coordinated the execution of several European Arrest Warrants, European Investigation Orders and legal procedures for seizing the proceeds of crimes.",0
106,Cyberfish Delivers Real-Time In-Attachment Phishing Detection | #networksecurity | #comptiasecurityplus,"Cyberfish has added a real-time in-attachment phishing detection module to its phishing protection solution for MSSPs, MSPs and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), according to a prepared statement.

The in-attachment phishing detection module uses Cyberfish’s Virtual Sandbox technology to replicate human vision and behavior, the company said. In doing so, the module helps organizations stop phishing attacks in real-time.

In-attachment document phishing attacks may occur via emails that contain links to Microsoft Office and Adobe PDF files, Cyberfish stated. During these attacks, cybercriminals impersonate a known sender and leverage these files to steal users’ credentials.

Cybercriminals also leverage HTML-based in-attachment phishing attacks to deliver phishing pages within emails, Cyberfish indicated. With these attacks, hackers utilize a phishing HTML file to illegally obtain users’ credentials.

Cyberfish’s phishing protection solution combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to stop phishing emails and websites in real-time, according to the company. Furthermore, the solution provides MSSPs and MSPs with multi-tenant management, reporting and integration capabilities.

How Does Cyberfish Work with MSSPs and MSPs?

MSSPs and MSPs can join Cyberfish’s partner program to integrate the company’s phishing protection capabilities into their portfolios. The program’s features include:

MSSPs and MSPs can use Cyberfish’s solution to identify malicious emails and websites and visually analyze phishing attacks, the company stated. They also can leverage the solution to generate phishing attack data and reports.",0

200,"Oil operators get DUCs in a row, adding fracking crews to boost output","DENVER (Reuters) - U.S. frackers have been bringing back equipment to boost production even with oil prices languishing around $40 a barrel, tapping into a backlog of drilled wells left uncompleted (DUCs) when oil prices crashed in the spring.

Oil producers halted expensive fracking operations when prices cratered on pandemic-related shutdowns and a price war. Among the first wells to be tapped when prices rebounded were those that had been drilled but not completed.

Because of the industry’s struggles, companies can hire service crews at a lower cost to finish those wells. U.S. production has rebounded, and any growth in coming months would likely result from completing wells, not drilling new ones.

The number of active hydraulic fracturing fleets has climbed by nearly 50% since mid-September to 127, according to data from consultancy Primary Vision, outpacing a roughly 17% jump in the number of active drilling rigs over that same period of time. That count stands at 296.

As of September, U.S. shale regions had nearly 7,600 drilled-but-uncompleted wells, according to U.S. Energy Department figures, down from roughly 8,200 a year earlier. Last year producers drilled many wells but did not complete them.

On Thursday, U.S. oil prices CLc1 were around $38.53 a barrel, below profitable levels in some U.S. producing basins. Still, hydraulic fracturing equipment is headed back to the field as producers try to deal with swift declines in shale well production, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects to fall to 7.7 million barrels per day in November from 9.2 million bpd in February.

Fracking was the first thing to get shut down when oil prices collapsed because it is the most expensive part of drilling and completing a well, said Andy Hendricks, chief executive officer of driller Patterson-UTI Energy PTEN.O. When prices rose, operators brought back frack crews to complete wells that were drilled, accounting for a big bump in activity.

The companies that specialize in well completions, like ProPetro Holding Corp PUMP.N and Liberty Oilfield Services LBRT.N, have said they are adding back workers.

“Oil focused operators and basins are trying to manage decline curves,” said Matt Johnson, chief executive of Primary Vision.

U.S. producers added as many as 1,200 DUCs in May, according to analysis from consultancy Enverus, but began completing wells at a faster rate than rigs could drill them starting around July. In October, operators were burning through DUCs at a rate of roughly 200 a month, Enverus said.

That pace could slow, Hendricks warned.

“I don’t expect big increases in frack activity from where we are. We just don’t have the inventory,” he said referencing drilled-but-uncompleted wells.

Apache Corp APA.O suspended drilling and fracking in the Permian Basin shale field in April, but said on Thursday during a call with analysts that it has hired two crews to complete a backlog of about 45 wells.

“We are now seeing very compelling service costs in the Permian Basin,” said CEO John Christmann.

Patterson-UTI, which has a larger contract drilling portfolio than hydraulic fracturing, bottomed out at four hydraulic fracturing fleets in June, but will average six fleets this quarter. Rival ProPetro is anticipated to average 9.5 fleets in the fourth quarter, versus four fleets in the second quarter of this year, according to analysts at investment firm Evercore ISI.",0
613,Proceed Of Crime Bill Will Fight Against Corruption – Senator Utazi,"The Senator Representing Enugu North zone and chairman of the Senate Committee on Primary Health Care, Chukwuka Utazi, has said that the proceed of crime bill would be important key to fight against corruption if passes into act.

Senator Utazi, disclosed this in a statement he made available to newsman in Abuja, noted that the bill in the last senate was unable to complete its journey to become an act due to the dissolution of the Federal Executive Council after the 2019 general election.

He explained the circumstance that led to the non-signing of the bill he sponsored in the last senate: “The issue is that all these anti-graft agencies that prosecute and seize properties are also keeping them.

ADVERTISEMENT

“They manage them until final forfeiture in the court. So, in the bill i sponsored in the 8th Assembly, we made it clear that the EFCC and other anti graft agencies don’t have the capacity to manage these assets. That is the essence of the bill.

“To start with, the proceed of crime bill is a statute of universal application because once you are a signatory to the United nations convention against corruption 2000, you are meant to do this.

“As a state party, once you become a signatory, you pick this legislation and domesticate it in your own environment and it begins to work for you, just like we did for the Mutual Legal Assistance. It is the same thing with this Proceed Of Crime,” he said.

Utazi, who chaired the last committee on anti-corruption in the 8th Senate, said, “Now that the Attorney General has come back without that law being signed and it has lapsed in line with the process of law making in Nigeria”.

He noted that the Attorney General has indicated that he will represent the bill. “When the bill come, we will look at the content to find out if it is the same as the one we passed in the 8th assembly or is it a new one with additional suggestions, we will consider them accordingly. But that law is very, very fundamental to the fight against corruption.

“It is important that government should profit from seized assets across the country and in fact, across the world. Once we have the assets management body, in the form of the proceed of crime agency, it becomes their duty, not that of the anti graft agency, to pursue and make sure that such assets in any part of the world are released to the Federal government and are managed anywhere they are, profitably for the country. That’s what should be done and we are waiting for the bill to come,” he added.

312,Millionaires pay little inheritance tax in Germany,"Germans who inherited wealth worth over €10 million ($11 million) in 2018 hardly had to pay any wealth or inheritance tax, the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) reported on Monday, referring to the government's response to a query from the opposition Left party.

According to Federal Statistics Office figures quoted by the paper, 600 rich Germans inherited last year wealth valued at around €31 billion paid a tax rate of around just 5%.

One reason is that fortunes are often passed down in the form of shares in companies.

Taxes levied on those inheriting wealth over €100 million were even lower. They paid an average tax of 0.2%, according to the government's response. In two-thirds of almost 40 such cases, wealth passed down completely tax-free.

""The higher the inherited or gifted assets, the lower the tax burden,"" Dietmar Bartsch, the head of the parliamentary Left party, told SZ, adding: ""Germany is a tax haven for multimillionaires.""

Growing calls for reform

Observers say tax policies over the past two decades have led to greater income and wealth disparity in Germany, with rich households benefiting from reductions in the top tax rate as well as the reform of inheritance tax.

Today, 45 households in Germany own as much wealth as the poorest half of the population, according to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW).

Calls have been growing louder in the country for the reintroduction of a wealth tax to halt the increasing divide between the rich and poor. Such a tax last existed in Germany in the mid-1990s.

But industry groups vehemently oppose the measure, arguing that it would have an adverse effect on economic activity, particularly Germany's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which provide well over half of all jobs in the country.

""If a company is bequeathed or given away, it usually requires the payment of far less tax than say, for example, inheriting securities or real estate,” Stefan Bach of the German Institute for Economic Research told SZ.

The Munich-based Ifo economic institute concluded in a 2018 report that the sector would be particularly at risk if the bar for wealth taxation was set too low.",0
463,Trump wanted to repeal an anti-corruption law so US businesses could bribe foreigners,"Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump grumbled to his secretary of state about a decades-old US law that bars American companies from bribing foreign officials and pledged to repeal it — which, incidentally, would make it easier for his company to get lucrative contracts abroad.

This comes from a new book by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, who won a Pulitzer Prize as part of a larger team covering Trump and Russia, titled A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump’s Testing of America. The book comes out next week, but their paper (unsurprisingly) got an advance copy and published some of the more eye-popping tidbits on Wednesday.

The most jarring is a scene from spring 2017, when Trump and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson tussled over the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. That law, according to the Justice Department, makes it “unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.”

Trump, the Post reports, bristled at that restriction.

“It’s just so unfair that American companies aren’t allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas,” Trump reportedly told Tillerson. “We’re going to change that.” Per the authors, the president expressed frustration “ostensibly because [the law] restricted his industry buddies or his own company’s executives from paying off foreign governments in faraway lands.”

“Ostensibly” is an important modifier here: It’s unclear whether Trump was explicit in his anger that his company couldn’t bribe foreigners, or if that is just the authors’ interpretation of his comments. Given his desire to make US companies more competitive in the global market, it’s certainly possible Trump had that in mind more than his personal fortune.

Either way, it says a lot about the president that he spent any amount of time in power advocating for more corruption and bribery, not less — particularly since he’s been trying to convince the American people that he’s an anti-corruption crusader as part of his impeachment defense.

That defense was always a bit hard to swallow for anyone who has been paying attention to Trump since, well, basically forever, but this anecdote just further illustrates how little Trump cares about fighting corruption in foreign countries. If anything, he seems to want more corruption.

This revelation on its own is explosive, but there are others worth noting in the book.

Trump’s ignorance hurts US foreign policy

Trump’s infatuation with Russian President Vladimir Putin is well chronicled, but Rucker and Leonnig’s work shows Trump was champing at the bit to meet the dictator even before he officially took over the White House:

“During the transition he interrupt[ed] an interview with one of his secretary of state candidates,” Rucker and Leonnig write. He cut in to ask: “When can I meet Putin? Can I meet with him before the inaugural ceremony?”

Trump finally got the chance to meet with Putin at the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg. After their talk, the authors write, the president considered himself a newly minted Russia expert — more so than Tillerson, who spent years doing business in Russia and interacting with Putin during his decades at ExxonMobil.

“I have had a two-hour meeting with Putin,” Trump reportedly told Tillerson. “That’s all I need to know. ... I’ve sized it all up. I’ve got it.”

And during an undated meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump made clear he was not brushed up on geography, telling the leader that the threat from China isn’t so bad since “It’s not like you’ve got China on your border.”

The problem is that India does, in fact, have China on its border.

According to one Trump aide who spoke to the reporters for the book, Modi was likely left gobsmacked by that meeting. “This is not a serious man. I cannot count on this man as a partner,” the aide characterized Modi as thinking. The aide noted that afterward, “the Indians took a step back” in their relationship with the US.

Put together, these excerpts paint a picture of a selfish, impetuous, astoundingly uninformed president potentially willing to commit crimes to get ahead. If all of this is true, it bolsters the case that Trump is a truly unfit president.

A very stable genius indeed.",0
623,Child Trafficking - Profiting from Vulnerability,"Loria-Mae Heywood draws attention to the market forces at play in the trafficking and exploitation of children, and provides examples of good practices from Europe, Africa and Asia in support of the protection of children against trafficking. She then champions the use of systemic and collaborative approaches, along with ethical practices to support the fight against child trafficking.

This is part of a forthcoming Global Policy e-book on modern slavery. Contributions from leading experts highlighting practical and theoretical issues surrounding the persistence of slavery, human trafficking and forced labour will be serialised here over the coming months.

In every society, be it ‘developed’ or ‘developing’, there will always be vulnerable children, the degree and extent of the vulnerabilities faced by such children differing within and across countries and communities. The circumstances and dispositions that contribute to, and facilitate the vulnerability of children could have a basis in a number of factors including, but not limited to, inadequate economic resources and financial alternatives, a lack of maturity of mind, weak guardianship systems, and inadequate societal exposure.

What is both disconcerting and repugnant is that traffickers have capitalised on such vulnerability factors, targeting boys and girls for their organs, and for the provision of labour, sexual, and other services. That children should be recruited, transported, transferred, harboured and/or received for the purpose of being exploited – the conception of child trafficking based on the UN Trafficking Protocol – speaks not only to the intentionality and criminality involved in trafficking; it also speaks to the bleak prospects that exist for the children whose human rights and dignity would be undermined at the hands of traffickers and at the hands of those who demand and use their bodies, labour, produce, and services for their benefit and pleasure.

Preventing the exploitation of children by addressing factors and practices which enable and facilitate the vulnerability of children is therefore an absolute imperative if children are to be saved the harrowing journeys and experiences that leave them traumatised, abused, and even dead. Focus will therefore be given to some of the strategies that have been used in an attempt to fight child trafficking, and correspondingly facilitate the protection of children. Prior to this focus, insight will be provided into the human trafficking industry – its estimated value, supply and demand factors that fuel this industry, and the children who have been detected and exploited as a consequence of this industry.

A billion-dollar industry

The trafficking in human beings, under which child trafficking is subsumed, is a billion-dollar industry. The specific profits derived from the exploitation of human beings, via trafficking, are not known due to the clandestine nature of trafficking. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the profits generated from forced labour (which includes but is not limited to labour derived from trafficking) amount to US$150 billion per year (ILO, 2014). This estimate is said to be a reflection of both the ILO’s use of an updated methodology from what was used in 2005 to determine the profits derived from the use of forced labour, and the use of data collected for the ILO’s 2012 Global Estimate of Forced Labour. It should be noted that profits generated from state-imposed forced labour are not covered in the 2014 and 2005 estimates. Asia, and Developed Economies are said to be the top sources of profits, with sexual exploitation gaining the highest level of profits of the respective sectors of exploitation. In 2005, economist Patrick Belser, via an ILO Working Paper, estimated that the yearly profits generated from forced labour was US$44 billion – a figure which includes the US$32 b illion in profits which the ILO, in 2005, estimated was generated per year by trafficked forced labourers. Most victims were trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation, followed by economic exploitation and mixed forms of exploitation. Further, industrialized countries accounted for half of the profits, while almost one-third of the profits was derived from Asia.

Susceptible to the workings of the market, the trafficking of children and the subsequent profits generated from the exploitation of children is fuelled by demand and supply. The excessive reference to ‘traffickers’ in human trafficking debates may lead one to infer that these actors are the main or only stakeholders in trafficking activities, and may even lead to a feeling of disconnect between the crime of trafficking and one’s personal actions. However, the demand and supply of child victims is fuelled by a number of actors who all contribute, wittingly or unwittingly, to the trafficking and exploitation of children.

On the demand side, employers and business owners, consumers and clients, and third parties such as recruiters and agents all contribute to the perpetuation of the child trafficking industry. For example, the loyal customer who buys beautiful sweaters for his family from his favourite local department store may be blissfully unaware that the fingers of those who knitted those sweaters were those of children recruited to work in deplorable factory conditions, and who received a mere pittance for the hours that they slaved over those items of clothing. Should that scenario be true, that customer would have unknowingly contributed to the demand for trafficked and exploited labour. He would also have profited from the vulnerability of children and the lack of adequate safeguards for the ethical sourcing of products within supply chains and webs, as would the businesses that sourced such products.

As a point of reference for the prevalence of goods potentially produced by child labour or forced labour, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) – an operating unit of the United States Department of Labor – revealed that the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor comprised 155 goods from 77 countries. Based on this 2020 report/list, the agriculture sector has the greatest amount of child labour and forced labour respectively, followed by the manufacturing, mining/quarrying and pornography sectors respectively. The top 3 goods with the most child labour are gold (22 countries), bricks (19 countries) and sugar cane (18 countries), while the top 3 goods with the most forced labour are bricks (9 countries), cotton (8 countries), and garments (7 countries).

But the furthering of the child trafficking industry and the profiting from the exploitation of children is not only due to demand factors but also to the presence of children who are at risk of being exploited. The supply of children to the child trafficking industry is facilitated by personal, socio-economic and cultural factors that make children vulnerable to trafficking, as well as the presence of individuals who are willing to facilitate their exploitation. These individuals have been and could be family members and persons known to the child/children, or they could be strangers. In Nigeria, for example, there exists a cultural practice of informal fostering in which parents or guardians, many times due to economic challenges, arrange for wealthier members of society to take care of their child/ children. In such arrangements, there is usually the expectation that the child would perform household or other tasks for the host family. This informal system of fostering, which has many positive attributes, has however sometimes been misused to facilitate the trafficking of children for domestic servitude, sexual exploitation and other forms of exploitation as host families take advantage of children in their care or as traffickers operate under the guise of arranging for children to be hosted and in turn facilitate their exploitation. Underpinning the vulnerability of children to trafficking and exploitation, in this instance, is the convergence of economic push factors and cultural enablers situated within the social and communal context of Nigeria. While push factors to trafficking differ across countries, it is common (like in this instance) for a combination of vulnerability factors, including the lack of suitable coping mechanisms and alternatives, to create an enabling environment for the trafficking and eventual exploitation of children.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that for the year 2016, of the fifty-four countries examined, children comprised approximately 30 per cent of detected victims, with there being far more girls than boys. Of the 2,350 girls detected, 72 per cent had been trafficked for sexual exploitation, 21 per cent for forced labour and 7 per cent for other purposes. In the case of the 711 boys detected, 50 per cent had been trafficked for forced labour, 27 per cent for sexual exploitation, and 23 per cent for other purposes. The ‘other purposes’ for which children had been trafficked included forced begging, forced marriage, forced criminal activities, and to serve as child soldiers. (See the UNODC’s Global Report on Trafficking in Persons – 2018.)

Trafficking has a human cost and the supply and succumbing of children to the trafficking industry makes it imperative to relentlessly pursue efforts to protect and prevent boys and girls from being trafficked and exploited. The three examples featured below serve the purpose of providing insight into efforts that have been made to fight child trafficking by targeting the protection of children. It is hoped that these revelations will provide inspiration for what could be done to fight child trafficking (adjusted to respective country contexts), as well as reveal that the protection of children against trafficking is of win-win benefit to children on the one hand, and businesses and the society at large on the other hand.

Example 1: The Wrap Around Model – the Netherlands

In the Netherlands, the Wrap Around Model has been used to provide composite and consolidated support to the Roma community in an attempt to tackle the trafficking of Roma children for forced criminal exploitation and forced begging. Implemented by the Dutch National Police in collaboration with government and civil society organisations, this Model (featured within Anti-Slavery International’s Trafficking for Forced Criminal Activities and Begging in Europe: Exploratory Study and Good Practice Examples report) is centred around the presence of individuals and services who/which ‘wrap themselves around’ vulnerable Roma families in an attempt to insulate children from trafficking and exploitation. This Model involves the assigning of a Family Manager to each family that is perceived to be at risk of child abuse and child trafficking. The Family Manager serves as the point of contact and intermediary between the designated family and professional support persons and organisations that are working with the family, be it the school, child protection service, housing association, or the police. This manner of operation and coordinated support has helped to provide vital support to target families, while also helping in the identification and prevention of trafficking and the exploitation of children.

Example 2: International Cocoa Initiative – Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire

Extending beyond a focus on child trafficking, the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) – a Swiss-based foundation operating in Ghana and the Ivory Coast – has been dedicated towards ensuring a better future for children, and advancing the elimination of child labour. Focusing its activities around the cocoa and chocolate industry, it has worked with multiple partners (including farming communities, businesses, unions, civil society groups and national governments in cocoa-producing countries) towards providing greater protection to children and their rights, managing the risk of child labour within the cocoa supply chain, and sharing knowledge and information in an open and transparent manner. Activities and actions performed in favour of the protection of children have included the following: the organisation of community mobilization meetings on the issues of child labour and child trafficking; the implementation of initiatives to reduce the vulnerability of children to child labour and child trafficking, including through school rehabilitation and the recruitment of teachers; and the establishment of Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation Systems which use facilitators within cocoa-growing communities to bring attention to child labour, and request the remediation of respective cases. (For further details on the ICI: Source(a); Source(b))

While trafficking into the cocoa sector and child labour within the cocoa sector have not been eliminated, the work by the ICI has contributed to the protection of children from child trafficking and child labour. Companies that pursue ethical practices and strive to fight against the exploitation of children within supply chains could be said to have greater prospects of good brand and company reputation, and the concomitant provision of support by members of the public. The converse should also be considered.

Example 3 – Peer educators and Socialization Centres – Bangladesh

As featured in the Background paper on Good Practices and Priorities to Combat Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children in Bangladesh, one of the strategies that has been employed in Bangladesh to raise awareness on children’s rights issues has been the use of boys and girls to share relevant information with their peers. The Association for Community Development (ACD) in Rajshahi, for example, has provided training to children, who have in turn discussed issues such as trafficking, early marriage, and sexual exploitation with their peers. Such discussions have been facilitated by adult women and adult men who work with the girls and boys respectively. One achievement, as detailed by a group of girls, was the identification of a suspected trafficker, after which the Union Parishad Chairman was informed.

As further seen via one of the child-focused web pages of the ACD, a community-based approach to the prevention and protection of children from trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, violence, abuse, and vulnerable situations is facilitated through the use of Socialization Centres. Focusing on the development of children and the community through socialization, services provided by Socialization Centres have included counselling, education on self-protection, and library services. Meetings have also been held with parents and other groups, with focus being given to mainstreaming out-of-school children and identifying children at risk. Other services performed through the Centres have included the following: parenting education sessions on issues such as understanding childhood and development; awareness-raising sessions on the protection of children at the level of the community and society, respectively; and the provision of vocational training to adolescent boys and girls from “untouchable, city slum and indigenous communities”. What is notable is that the voices of children have also been integrated into community-based approaches; children have been used in local-level advocacy so that the community-based governance structure could be more child-sensitive and proactive. The initiatives by the ACD have been said to increase individual and community participation in reducing, inter alia, child marriage, sexual abuse, child labour, trafficking, and discrimination.

Effecting positive change

As contemplation is given to the trafficking and exploitation of children in and from different parts of the globe and the actions that have been directed towards the protection of children, it is evident that only through sustained, individual, collaborative, cross-sectoral, inter-sectoral and sustainable efforts could there be any hope of protecting children from trafficking, and reducing the profitability of the trafficking industry. Such efforts should not be merely directed towards alleviating current realities and influencing consumer habits but should rather be combined with systemic changes.

Awareness-raising, the provision of education and skills training, and the monitoring of supply chains, while important, are surface-oriented strategies. If sustained and sustainable change is to be effected, such efforts need to be combined with the building and strengthening of child protection and social protection systems, the provision of suitable alternatives to those who are at a risk of being trafficked, and the creation, implementation and enforcement of laws that are deemed suitable to support the protection of children and conversely respond to the abuse of children and their rights.

As consumerism is replaced with responsible and ethical consumption, as businesses support and enforce ethical practices, as family systems are strengthened, and as long-term and systemic child protection inputs are made, greater possibilities will exist for the protection of children against trafficking. There is no guarantee that such efforts will result in the transformation of an individual’s character, and in turn increase the value that such an individual attaches to children and their lives. However, the strengthening of child protection and social protection systems and the implementation and enforcement of child protection regulations may, at least, help to curb human deficiencies by facilitating the regulation of conduct.",0
612,"‘Shark Tank’s’ Barbara Corcoran fell for this very common phishing scam — and it cost her almost $400,000","This common email phishing scam just caught a Shark.

“Shark Tank” star and real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran revealed Wednesday that she lost almost $400,000 after scammers tricked her bookkeeper by sending a bill that appeared to come from her assistant.

“Lesson learned: Be careful when you wire money!” Corcoran tweeted on Wednesday. She also confirmed to ABC News that, “This morning I wired $388,000 into a false bank account in Asia.”

So how did such a savvy businesswoman and entrepreneur get duped? The same way that the many companies who have lost $26 billion through email wire fraud since 2016 have, according to the FBI: a criminal was able to impersonate a trusted business partner.

Corcoran’s team did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment, but the millionaire investor explained what happened to ABC News. Last week, Corcoran’s bookkeeper Christina received what appeared to be a routine invoice from Corcoran’s assistant Emily to approve a $388,700.11 payment to a German company called FFH Concept.

The bookkeeper replied asking, “What is this? Need to know what account to pay out of,” and the cybercriminal posing as Emily was able to give a credible, detailed response that FFH was designing German apartment units that Corcoran had invested in. Corcoran does invest in real estate, and FFH is a real company in Germany.

“Someone sends you a bill. It’s paid,” Corcoran told ABC News. “In this one instance, it was not a good strategy.”

Because as it turned out, Emily never sent the invoice; the phony bill came from an email that closely resembled hers, but it was missing an “O.” Corcoran’s team didn’t realize something was off about the “from” email until after the money was transferred.

Corcoran does not blame her bookkeeper for getting conned by the sophisticated scam. “When she showed me the emails that went back and forth with the false address, I realized immediately it’s something I would have fallen for if I had seen the emails,” Corcoran said.

Indeed, her “Shark Tank” costar Robert Herjavec, who made his millions founding and running his Herjavec Group cybersecurity firm, told ABC News that this is “very, very common.”

“Eighty-five percent of all cybercrime across the world comes through email, which is what happened to Barbara,” he said. “It’s been happening to businesses for two, three years now. It’s now happening to individuals.”

His tips for not falling prey to the same ruse include always verifying that an email is coming from someone you trust, even going as far as to have that person call you to confirm the details.

“Number two, check your bank statements every single day, because if you catch it within 48 hours, the bank can get it back for you,” he said.

Unfortunately in Corcoran’s case, that $388,700.11 is long gone. But her team has traced the original emails to a Chinese IP address, and her legal team is working out its next steps.

Here are some more tips to avoid increasingly sophisticated phishing scammers, such as email wire fraud, online dating traps and social media shopping scams.",0
254,Reuven Rivlin,"Reuven ""Ruvi"" Rivlin (Hebrew: רְאוּבֵן ""רוּבִי"" רִיבְלִין‎, [ʁeʔuˈven ʁivˈlin] (listen); born 9 September 1939) is an Israeli politician and lawyer who has served as the current President of Israel since 2014. He is a member of the Likud party. Rivlin was Minister of Communications from 2001 to 2003, and subsequently served as Speaker of the Knesset from 2003 to 2006 and 2009 to 2013. On 10 June 2014, he was elected President of Israel. [1]

Rivlin argues for a Greater Israel that would embrace all people and give the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza full Israeli citizenship. [2] He is also a strong supporter of minority rights, particularly for Arab Israelis. [3] [4] He supports the one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Rivlin is fluent in Arabic. [5] [6]

Early life

Reuven Rivlin was born in Jerusalem during the Mandate era to the Rivlin family, which has lived in Jerusalem since 1809. He is a descendant of students of the Vilna Gaon. His parents were Rachel ""Ray"" Rivlin and Yosef Yoel Rivlin. Yosef created the first Hebrew edition of the Koran [7] and was a candidate for president of Israel in 1957 before withdrawing in favor of the incumbent Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. [8] [9] Reuven Rivlin is the great-grandson of Yosef Rivlin, a founder of Jerusalem's Nahalat Shiv'a neighborhood. [10]

Rivlin attended Gymnasia Rehavia high school, and served in the Intelligence Corps of the Israel Defense Forces. During the Six-Day War, he fought with the Jerusalem Brigade and accompanied the Paratroopers Brigade as an intelligence officer. After military service, he studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. [11]

Before entering politics, Rivlin served as legal advisor of the Beitar Jerusalem Sports Association, manager of the Beitar football team, and chairman of the association; member of the Jerusalem City Council; member of the El Al Board; Chairman of the Israel Institute for Occupational Safety and Hygiene; a board member of the Khan Theater, and board member of the Israel Museum. [11]

Political career

He was first elected to the 12th Knesset in 1988, and served as Likud chairman from 1988 to 1993. He lost his seat in the 1992 elections, but returned to the Knesset following the 1996 elections. Re-elected in 1999, he was appointed Minister of Communications in March 2001, serving until February 2003, when he was elected Knesset Speaker following the 2003 elections. During his term as Speaker, he was criticized for breaking the tradition of political neutrality of the post; he was one of Ariel Sharon 's harshest critics regarding the disengagement plan, and had a public confrontation with Aharon Barak, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, concerning the court's authority to declare legislation illegal. [12]

Rivlin was re-elected in 2006 and 2009. He ran in the 2007 election for President as the Likud candidate. He withdrew after the first round of voting when it became clear that Kadima MK Shimon Peres had sufficiently broad support to inevitably win in a run-off.

On 30 March 2009, the Knesset elected Rivlin as Speaker with a majority of 90 votes out of 120. [13]

For his first official visit as Knesset Speaker, he chose the Arab-Israeli town of Umm al-Fahm, just south of the Galilee. He was accompanied by MKs Uri Orbach (The Jewish Home) and Afu Agbariyah (Hadash), a resident of the city. [14] [15]

Since 1999, Rivlin has employed Rivka Ravitz, a Haredi woman, first as his bureau chief and campaign advisor, and, upon his election to President, as his chief of staff. [16] Ravitz is credited with managing Rivlin's successful campaigns for Knesset Speaker and President of Israel, and often accompanies him on his local appearances, as well as visits to foreign heads of state. [17]

Rivlin was elected as the 10th President of Israel on 10 June 2014, receiving the support of 63 MKs in a runoff vote against MK Meir Sheetrit. In his bid to become President, he won support from both Arab legislators who appreciated his courtesy, and from right-wingers like Naftali Bennett and Danny Danon, who join him in a desire to make the West Bank a part of Israel proper. [18]

Rivlin was sworn in on 24 July 2014, succeeding Shimon Peres. [19] Upon his election as President, he immediately ceased being a member of the Israeli Parliament.

On March 25, 2015, Rivlin, in his role as President, officially chartered Benjamin Netanyahu with the assignment of forming a new government following elections the previous week. In his remarks during the ceremony, Rivlin noted that the first priority of the new government should be to mend the frayed relationship Israel's government has with the United States, and he expressed his disapproval of Netanyahu's election day exhortation that Arab voters were being bused to polling booths by NGOs and were voting ""in droves"". ""One who is afraid of votes in a ballot box will eventually see stones thrown in the streets"", said Rivlin.

Other critical issues he recommended the new government address included establishing greater stability to avoid early elections and ""healing the wounds, mending the painful rifts, which have gaped open in the past years, and widened further in the course of this recent election"". [20]

In July 2015, following Rivlin's condemnation of the firebombing of a Palestinian home by suspected Jewish extremists that resulted in the death of a Palestinian toddler, Rivlin received death threats. Rivlin labelled those who committed the violence as ""terrorists"", lamenting that his own people had ""chosen the path of terror"", and that Israel was lax in confronting Jewish religious terrorism and Jewish extremists. [21]

On September 25, 2019, following elections, Rivlin gave Netanyahu, the head of the larger bloc, the first opportunity to pull together a coalition. When Netanyahu was unable to do so, Rivlin gave the opportunity to Benny Gantz. Should Gantz fail, any MK will have 21 days to garner a Knesset majority to form a government. [22] On November 21, 2019, Rivlin gave formal notice to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein that Benny Gantz's mandate to form a government had drawn to a close and the mandate to create a governing coalition would now lie with the Knesset. This is the first time in Israel's history that the Knesset has been tasked with doing so, and should it fail to do so, a new election will be called. [23]

Although considered a nationalist and hawkish on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Rivlin is a supporter of minority rights, particularly those of the Arab-Israelis. As speaker of the Knesset, Rivlin made his first official visit to the Arab-Israeli city of Umm al-Fahm, often portrayed as a locus of anti-state and pro-Palestine sentiment and agitation. [24]

In June 2010, Rivlin ignored calls to remove Balad MK Haneen Zoabi for joining the Gaza flotilla. Rivlin's actions in defending the parliamentary rights of Zoabi were criticized by some, but others praised his courage in defending Israeli democracy. [25] The same year, a group of rabbis on government payroll called on Jewish Israelis to not rent apartments to non-Jews. Rivlin protested this declaration, saying, ""In my opinion, their statement shames the Jewish people. If such a thing were said in relation to Jews anywhere on the globe, a hue and cry would be raised in Israel on the need to stand up against anti-Semitism.""

When asked about conditions for African refugees in Israel Rivlin stated, ""As a democrat and a Jew, I have a hard time with concentration camps, where people are warehoused."" [26] In 2013, Rivlin slammed Beitar fans who chanted anti-Arab slogans when two Arab players were added to the team. [27] Rivlin told a gathering of academics: ""Israeli society is sick, and it is our duty to treat this disease."" [28]

In November 2014, Rivlin cancelled a scheduled performance of Amir Benayoun after the singer released an anti-Arab song. [29] [30] In 2016, Rivlin forbid Balad MK Jamal Zahalka to enter the presidential residence (""Beit HaNassi""), after Zahalka and other MKs of Balad met with the families of Palestinians who were killed while attacking Israeli civilians. [31]

In 2000, Rivlin supported legislation that would make it illegal for women to wear prayer shawls. The law was not passed, but Rivlin's position on the issue led to estrangement with his American-Israeli feminist cousin, Lilly Rivlin. [32] In 2008, the Knesset choir sang the ""Hatikva"" at a welcoming ceremony without the female members of the choir. Rivlin admitted that as Knesset speaker, he was careful not to invite women to sing so as not to create a conflict with Orthodox Jews. [33]

Rivlin has voiced support for a version of a one-state solution, and remains a staunch supporter of Jewish settlement in the West Bank. [34] In 2010, he said that he ""would rather accept Palestinians as Israeli citizens than divide Israel and the West Bank in a future two-state peace solution"". [35]

According to Rivlin, Israel's fight is not with the Palestinian people or Islam, but against murderous terrorism. [36] He pointed out that Palestinians could not be expected to accept a two-state solution where ""one state is an invincible superpower, and the other is sub-autonomous"", [37] while declaring that, ""West Bank settlements are as Israeli as Tel Aviv"". [38] He told Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, ""Israel is working and trying to bring an end to the tragedy with the Palestinians. We must respect the idea (of a Palestinian state) because they're here, and they must recognize the idea that the Jewish nation has returned to its homeland. These are difficult challenges when there is no trust between nations."" [39]

Although not Orthodox himself, Rivlin has been critical of non-Orthodox movements in Judaism. In 1989, Rivlin referred to Reform Jews as ""idol worshippers"", and refused to call Reform Jewish rabbis by their title. [40] [41] Prior to becoming President, he opposed granting equal status to Reform or Conservative Judaism. [42] In 2014, Rivlin said that if non-Orthodox conversion standards were adopted, Jewish status would be based on ""a civic definition rather than a religious definition"", echoing a Knesset speech he gave in 2006 when he declared: ""I have no doubt, and my positions are known, that the status of Judaism according to halachah (Jewish law) is what has kept us going for 3,800 years."" [43]

In November 2014, however, Rivlin welcomed at his residence over 50 Reform leaders on the Board of Governors of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and told them, ""We are one family and the connection between all Jews, all over the world, is very important to the State of Israel."" [44] In 2015, he did not allow a Conservative rabbi to officiate at a bar mitzvah service at his residence for disabled children who attended a program run by the Conservative movement, [45] but later hosted representatives of the Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Jewish communities for a joint study session at the President's Residence. [46]

Rivlin once campaigned for Israel to recognize the Armenian Genocide. [47] In 2012, he said, ""It is our moral duty to remember and remind of the tragedy that befell the Armenian people, who lost more than a million of its sons during the First World War, and we must not make this a political issue. I am aware of the sensitivity of this issue. But let us be clear: This is not an accusation of Turkey today or of the current Turkish government."" [48] As president, he has been less vocal on this issue. Concerned about the negative reaction of Turkey if the president signed the petition, unnamed officials of the Foreign Ministry welcomed what they called Rivlin's ""statesmanship"". [49]

In February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that ""there were Jewish perpetrators"" of the Holocaust, ""not only German perpetrators."" [50] President Rivlin condemned his words: ""Saying that our people collaborate with the Nazis is a new low...today, more than ever, we must work to educate the world, even some of the leaders, about that dark time."" [51]

President Rivlin took part in the March of the Living in Poland on April 12, 2018. In the meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda, he said: ""There is no doubt that there were many Poles who fought the Nazi regime, but we cannot deny that Poland and Poles had a hand in the extermination."" [52]

Personal life

He was married to Nechama Rivlin from 1971 until her death in 2019, and has four children. [53] [54] Rivlin has been a vegetarian since the late 1960s. [55] Rivlin has been a supporter of the Beitar Jerusalem football club [56] since the age of seven, when he attended his first game. [54]

Controversy

According to the Jerusalem Post Rivlin gave a speech in 2017 that criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government, saying he had witnessed a ""continued effort to weaken the gatekeepers of Israeli democracy"" and speaking also about the role of the judiciary in Israeli democracy: [57]

There is an abyss between the responsible and courageous attempt to define, after years, the relations between the legislative and judicial branches, to draw borders for judicial criticism, ask questions about appointments, aim for a more varied and representative group of judges – and the attempt to terrorize the [Supreme] Court, weaken it as an institution and invite the public to undermine its authority and rulings.

A few days after the speech graffiti in Bnei Brak appeared calling Rivlin a ""Nazi apostate from Judaism"". Police were called to investigate the incident. [57]

606,Insider trading in the mind,"In India and around the world, a series of embarrassing insider trading scams have shaken the public’s trust in capital markets. Investors are getting increasingly sceptical as more and larger scams continue to be reported on the heels of the global financial crisis.

Insider trading has been prevalent since the inception of the stock markets. The US was the first to enforce legal prohibitions on it almost 50 years ago; others followed in the 1980s and 1990s. In India, the concept started fermenting in the 1980s and came to be observed extensively in the 1990s and 2000s.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines insider trading as “the buying or selling of stocks and other securities while in possession of material, non-public information about the security"". Insider information would give one party an unfair advantage over other market players.

In this study, we will assess the broader impact of insider trading on the stock market and draw conclusions about the psyche of investors. We started by identifying a diverse set of countries—India, the US, France, Japan and Australia. We gathered 10-year data (2001-2010) on stock market indices and the number of insider trading incidents reported and investigated by the respective regulatory agencies in these countries. We looked at the absolute annual change in the stock market index as a standard basis for comparison across these markets. A ratio of “absolute annual change in the stock market index to the total number of insider trading incidents in that year"" was calculated, that the authors term as the Insider Trading Sensitivity Index (ITSI). ITSI has the following properties:

(i) A high (or low) ratio indicates that the absolute change in the stock index is high (or low);

(ii) A high (or low) ratio could also mean that for the same change in the index, the number of incidents are low (or high); and

(iii) A low (or high) ratio can also be a result of very high (or low) incidents and a low change in the stock index.

Of the five countries considered, Australia had the highest number of insider trading incidents per year (73), followed by the US (52). Japan, India and France reported an average of 15-20 incidents a year.

The ITSI ratio for the five countries over the last 10 years shows an interesting pattern (see table). India has the highest ratio, followed by France, the US, Australia and Japan.

With all things equal or controlled for, the sensitivity index shows that anytime an insider trading incident is reported, the investing public in India appears to become more “rattled"" than that in the other countries. Whereas, the Japanese investing public seems to be the least worried about insider trading reports.

One possible explanation is the level of confidence investors have in the capital markets and their belief that checks and balances exist (or don’t) in the regulatory systems to protect them.

Investors in the US, Australia and Japan may have more confidence in their regulatory framework, and may feel that their regulatory agencies will be able to properly prosecute such incidents and streamline processes to curb future ones.

However, investors in India, and to some extent those in France, may not have the same level of confidence and may worry that appropriate checks and balances are not in place to detect and prosecute such cases. In the Indian context for instance, even though Sebi has strengthened anti-insider trading laws since 2002, it has often failed to prove its cases due to alleged lack of evidence and investigative resources.

Perhaps there is also an ideological aspect to insider trading that could have a bearing on the sensitivity index. Though Japan enacted its first law against insider trading in 1988, “even today many Japanese do not understand why this is illegal. Indeed, previously it was regarded as common sense to make a profit from your knowledge"". (Roderick Seeman, Japan Law). This belief could partly explain the lower sensitivity index for Japan.

Compare this with France, where anti-insider trading efforts were considered consistent with the Gaullist ideal of linking “capital and work"" in setting up a trend towards the diffusion of shares in the public. Accordingly, there appears to be a strong belief that individuals holding only a few shares should get the same information as the affluent investor. Hence France’s relatively higher score on the sensitivity index. This also seems to echo well with the Indian belief system. Despite recurring scams, India investors appear to expect a high moral ground from financial markets. This attitude could partly explain the higher sensitivity towards insider trading.

It appears that in addition to regulatory systems, the politics of insider trading is dominated by values aimed at controlling and restraining greed. Laws try to ensure fairness by minimizing unfair benefits and restoring a level playing field that is fundamental to capital markets.

452,Multiple agency anti-corruption task team prioritizes 223 cases,"President Cyril Ramaphosa says the multiple agency anti-corruption task team, established after his announcement during the State of the Nation Address this year, is making headway and has prioritized 223 cases.

The President said this when he fielded oral questions in the National Assembly on Thursday.

""Much work has been done to ensure that these agencies have the necessary skills, the personnel and the resources that they need to undertake the demanding task of detecting, investigating and successfully prosecuting instances of corruption.

""In the main, it has also been the process of rebuilding these institutions. A crucial part of this work has been to improve a number of aspects of how they do their work. For instance, it has been to improve information sharing among them, coordination and cooperation and also doing so with other related institutions and not only law enforcement agencies.

""This is evident in the revitalization in the multi-agency anti-corruption task team which currently has 223 prioritized cases at different stages of investigation and prosecution,"" he said.

The President said the fight against corruption and state capture has required quite extensive measures to stabilize and revitalize law enforcement agencies.

""We have had to do that with capable and ethical leadership that is able to restore the capability of these vital institutions,"" he said.

He said much of the past two years has been focused on building up the capabilities of the institutions that the country relies on to combat corruption and state capture.

""… in recent months, there has been clear evidence of progress in bringing cases to court. Work is underway.""

He said, meanwhile, that government had dedicated resources to fight COVID-19 related corruption.

Since the beginning of the sixth administration, the elite crime-fighting unit the Hawks has established task teams to fast-track corruption investigations in municipalities, government and the private sector, the President said.

""Together with the NPA, the Hawks prioritized 10 corruption-related cases to fast track investigations and prosecutions.""

He said after he appointed the Investigative Directorate within the NPA to focus on serious corruption and state capture, personnel have been seconded from the SA Police Service, the Hawks and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), as well as forensic specialists and officials from SA Revenue Service, among others.

""Recent amendments to the state capture commission now allows the commission to share information records, documents, directly with the Investigative Directorate and any law enforcement agencies in South Africa.""",0
315,Treasury looking at tightening tax evasion laws,"So, what is to be done?

After all the sound and fury over tax evasion, a question in many people's minds is whether anything is actually happening to tighten the rules on income and capital held abroad.

Well, the answer to that is yes.

Last April, George Osborne spoke at the International Monetary Fund in Washington and revealed that he wanted to see change.

""We are changing the balance of the law so the burden of proof falls on those who are hiding their money offshore and we don't have to prove that they intended to do so,"" he said.

The Chancellor was referring to undeclared income held in offshore bank accounts and whether holding such accounts could in itself constitute a criminal offence.

At present prosecution authorities have to prove intent, a pretty high bar which means that successful cases are rare.

I am told that the Treasury is now preparing legislation to tighten the rules.

The process has been frustratingly slow.

A consultation programme was launched in the summer and many expected that new rules would be included in the Autumn Statement last December.

But, tax reformers were disappointed.

I am told the reason for the delay was a change in the ""policy landscape"" - that is, a new agreement between national governments on the automatic exchange of information on tax matters.

That agreement between members of the OECD has to be factored in to the new UK crackdown.

Treasury sources say that Mr Osborne is still as keen as he was last April to push through new legislation.

And with the Treasury Select Committee announcing an inquiry into the HSBC tax evasion allegations, it is clear this will remain high on the political agenda.",0
223,Libya's Parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh Issa arrives in Geneva for ceasefire talks,"The speaker of Libya's eastern-based parliament Aguila Saleh Issa arrived in Geneva on Friday for discussions over how to resume the ceasefire talks aimed at ending the ongoing conflict in the country.

Saleh is expected to meet with Stephanie Williams, the American deputy head of the United Nations Support Mission, and European officials.

Saleh heads the Libyan parliament which recognizes the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Khalifa Haftar, which has been fighting against the Turkish-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) for control of the country.

For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

The GNA recently gained ground against the LNA, breaking the siege of Tripoli and capturing the Watiya airbase. It now threatens the LNA-controlled strategic city of Sirte.

The LNA is backed by Egypt, the UAE, France, and Russia.",0
474,‘Terrorist attack is likely’ warns top counter terror police chief,"A Scotland Yard counter terrorist police chief has warned that a terrorist “attack remains likely” and stressed the national terror threat is at “substantial” as people return to crowded places.

The national policing lead for protective security Lucy D’Orsi said. “As a senior officer in counter terrorism it is my responsibility to share with the public where we see the current threat position.

“And what we see is that it is no different, it is still at substantial, so it is no different to where it was prior to lockdown.

“As we come out of lockdown, I think it is really important to remind people that the threat level from terrorism remains at substantial, which means an attack is likely.”

D’Orsi wanted to remind the public that we have just passed the three-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks that hit London Bridge and the Manchester Arena.

The Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner said, “We’re all going to look forward to going back to crowded places, iconic locations.

“I would just really ask that people stay alert as they were before.

“It was only in the last couple of weeks when we’ve been reflecting on London Bridge three years ago, Manchester Arena three years ago.

“We just need the public to stay alert and play their part in national security, to create a hostile environment for terrorists to operate in.”

She added, “There is a risk of radicalisation. We’ve adjusted some of our work in terms of stepping up the online work that we do.

“We’ve seen evidence that there has been a change in propaganda, which is seeking to divide communities, and I absolutely believe that communities defeat terrorism, so ensuring that the propaganda isn’t believed and the communities aren’t divided has really been important.”",0
431,Ukraine looks at ‘smart’ practices of 5 European anti-corruption agencies,"UNDP in Ukraine’s Enhanced Public Sector Transparency and Integrity Project (2015-2018) aims at ensuring the compliance of Ukrainian corruption prevention institutions with international standards for transparency and accountability and, thus, helping them become more responsive and effective.

The project has released a praxis case report for Ukraine’s National Agency for Prevention of Corruption (NAPC), titled “European Anti-Corruption Agencies: Key Preventive Mechanisms.” This case report summarizes smart practices used by five European anti-corruption agencies in Slovenia, Macedonia, Serbia, Latvia, and Romania. It presents them for possible application by the NAPC.

Among others, the report concentrates on issues of institutional architecture, provides analysis of key preventive mechanisms, including asset declaration verification, conflict of interest or whistle-blower protection, and offers key lessons learned accumulated over the years. The research results from collaboration of a group of UNDP-commissioned experts.

The report is one of the tools designed for the NAPC as part of the initial institution-building package. It is expected to help enable the newly created Ukrainian institution benefit from corruption prevention experiences of similar agencies and structures in Europe.

The Enhanced Public Sector Transparency and Integrity Project waslaunched in March 2016 with funding support from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It aims to review existing impediments towards the full functioning of the NAPC, galvanize the deployment of its mandate, and ensure the development of conflict of interest management and an effective e-asset declarations verification system.

“Ukraine sets sail for an ambitious anti-corruption reform which cannot be completed without a sound institutional architecture [such as the NAPC],” said Janthomas Hiemstra, UNDP Country Director in Ukraine.",0
90,The Danger of Rumors of Bribery and Corruption,"The Actual and Potential Impacts of Allegations

Corporate boards may be due for a rude awakening; they’d be well-advised to assess the harm allegations of corruption and other unethical conduct can do to their company’s share price, including its market capitalization. Corporate directors and officers are under three general legal duties: the duty to act carefully, the duty to act loyally and the duty to act lawfully.

Corporate board members devote significant time to financial oversight and strategy while often neglecting steps needed to protect and promote the company’s most important intangible asset: its culture and reputation. The negative effects of mere rumors of bribery and corruption can often be as problematic as clear accusations or even convictions.

The duty of care of corporate directors and officers is a special case of the duty of care imposed throughout the law under the general heading of negligence. Laws builds on moral, policy and experiential propositions. The law of negligence is no exception. The moral proposition that underlies the law of negligence is that if a person assumes a role whose performance involves risk that affect others, this person is under a moral duty to perform that role carefully. Therefore, corporate directors and officers are under an obligation to take steps to affirmatively reduce risks, and an omission may be wrongful.

On this foundation of moral blame, the law of negligence has erected a structure of legal blame or liability. The structure of legal blame under the law of negligence generally parallels the structure of moral blame.

Because government officials are engaged by definition in governing, their decisions will often have adverse effects on other persons. When officials are threatened with personal liability for acts taken pursuant to their official duties, they may well be induced to act with an excess of caution or otherwise to skew their decisions in ways that result in less than full fidelity to the objective and independent criteria that ought to guide their conduct.

Among the justifications for holding individuals “responsible according to a standard they cannot meet” are the administrative difficulty of distinguishing between an incapacity to exercise care and a failure to exercise care, and the policy judgment that, in the end, the objective of compensating the injured is more important than the objective of running a purely fault-based system.

There are plenty of case studies that evaluate the impact of the loss of trust from key stakeholders resulting from public rumors and allegations. These stakeholders may be the general public and institutional investors, but they also include existing and potential clients. Institutional investors in particular are increasingly sensitive to compliance-related violations (or rumors thereof) by companies within their portfolio. As an example, the world’s largest pension fund (Norwegian Government Pension Fund) excluded ZTE from funding due to alleged corrupt behavior.

International authorities are beginning to establish a track record of corporate convictions and multimillion-dollar penalties. Recent and ongoing criminal prosecutions of individuals have also put executives on notice that they, too, will face the harsh consequences of violating anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA). Under Canada’s Integrity Regime, companies that do business with government also face suspension or debarment when charged or convicted under the CFPOA or similar foreign anti-corruption laws.

Internationally, recent cases have shown that enforcement agencies are going to continue to scrutinize anti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABC) compliance programs and will likely bring charges when violations are the result of willful or reckless conduct. In particular, enforcement agencies may bring charges when there is a failure to adequately ensure the existence of an effective ABC compliance program resulting in the failure to prevent violations of the law.

Therefore, board members and executives must protect their organizations and themselves by effectively implementing a robust ABC compliance program, as well as by maintaining effective detection and investigation procedures, including continuously improving the effectiveness of any existing ABC compliance program.

In conclusion, here are some useful suggestions that were shared with me by Mrs. Huguette Labelle (who has chaired the Board of Directors of Transparency International). Hopefully these will proven useful to board members and executives:

Sustained leadership on transparency and integrity is vital.
Strong anti-corruption measures and repeated staff training is crucial.
The compliance office must be answering directly to the CEO and reporting regularly to the board.
When allegations occur, move quickly with a forensic audit. If criminal issues are uncovered, turn them over to the appropriate authorities.
Ensure that the staff remuneration is not an incentive to sell contracts at all cost.
Make it clear in documentation that this is a “clean” company that does not bribe – this has been demonstrated to be a deterrent for bribe asking.
Include in the external audit a review of the compliance on anti-corruption measures.
Ensure full transparency in contract management.
Publish who the real beneficial owners of their company and subsidiaries are.",0
8,"Racism has cost the U.S. $16 trillion, Citigroup finds","America could have been $16 trillion richer if not for inequities in education, housing, wages and business investment between Black and White Americans over the past 20 years, new research concludes.

The study, released this week by Citigroup, is the latest in a body of research that attempts to quantify the economic impact of systemic racism. Citigroup arrived at its $16 trillion figure after estimating that:

Black workers have lost $113 billion in potential wages over the past two decades because they couldn't get a college degree.
The housing market lost $218 billion in sales because Black applicants couldn't get home loans.
About $13 trillion in business revenue never flowed into the economy because Black entrepreneurs couldn't access bank loans.

What's more, the U.S. could have $5 trillion in gross domestic product over the next five years if those gaps and others were closed today, the study indicated.

""Racial inequality has always had an outsized cost, one that was thought to be paid only by underrepresented groups,"" Citigroup Banking Chair Raymond McGuire said in a statement. ""What this report underscores is that this tariff is levied on us all.""

Federal Reserve data show that White households' net worth grew 43%, to $61,200, between 1995 and 2016, while it remained flat at $35,400 for Black families. Moody's Investor Service found that 44% of Black households owned their homes in 2019, compared with 74% of white households.

The study also highlights the ""real costs of long-standing discrimination against minority groups, especially against Black people and particularly in the U.S.,"" Citigroup economist Catherine Mann said in a statement.

A McKinsey study released last year explored how these and other inequities have reduced the nation's wealth. The nation's GDP — the total value of goods and services — could be up to 6% higher by 2028 if the racial wealth gap is closed, the consulting firm concluded. Lawmakers must pass targeted policies that boost household income for Black Americans in order to address the issue, McKinsey said.

""The country has over a trillion dollars to gain from the effort,"" the McKinsey study concluded.

Incarceration rates among Black Americans, voter suppression efforts and conscious bias in hiring all play a role in hindering the U.S. from making strides in closing this gap, Citigroup said.

Separately, the financial giant on Wednesday said it would direct $1 billion toward helping close the racial wealth gap, including investing $550 million over the next three years in encouraging homeownership for people of color. Another $50 million will go toward capital investments for Black entrepreneurs.",0
542,BLOG - 1 September 2020,"For the moment, Giuseppe Conte's popularity remains high, although it has somewhat declined: he scores 60% of favourable opinion, and is still well ahead of his rivals, Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Fratelli d'Italia party, and his allies Luigi Di Maio and Nicola Zingaretti of the Democratic Party. One may wonder whether his popularity will persist. When the pandemic peaked, it seemed more institutional than personal. Italians stood united behind the President of the Council, deaf to the demagogic discourse of Matteo Salvini saying one thing and then the opposite within a 24-hours cycle. The polls in the last few months have shown that Giuseppe Conte’s personal image has been consolidated. He is considered a responsible and determined man, who sits above party politics. However, the perils for him are plentiful. Giuseppe Conte risks paying dearly for the economic and social crisis that is looming with the new school year. His priority is to work on recovery. But differences with Confindustria and the unions persist. And ensions are extremely strong between the Ministry of Public Education in Rome, the regions and the teachers' unions, over the conditions for the start of the school year. Moreover, he is sitting on an ejection seat. As has been said, Lega Nord and Fratelli d'Italia continue to wage a real guerrilla war against him, taking it as far as organizing street demonstrations. These parties are alarmed by the risks that Giuseppe Conte would pose to democracy, since he has obtained from the Senate an extension of the state of emergency until October 15. The greater part of the majority, as well as legal and constitutional experts also criticized this provision. More generally, manoeuvres, often on the initiative of Matteo Renzi, are being undertaken by the majority to eventually get rid of him, and Conte still does not have an elected representative or a political party to rely on. Polls show that he could secure an electoral base if he entered the political competition alone, or if he became the leader of the Five Star Movement, though there is no consensus within the party on that. In doing so, he would move away from his image of being above party politics. In addition, Giuseppe Conte should meditate on Mario Monti’s experience, who equally enjoyed strong support as President of the Council before he was defeated when he founded his movement and embarked on the 2013 election campaign. In short, Giuseppe Conte's political future remains uncertain.

This uncertainty could however dissipate with the next elections. On September 20 and 21, Italians will be called to the polls for a referendum vote on the reduction of the number of members of parliament and for municipal and regional elections. The outcome of these consultations will certainly have an impact on Italian political life and will clarify the different political scenarios. But no matter which scenario will prevail in Italy – whether a change or the maintaining of the Chief Executive, the hypothetical possibility Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia’s integration into the parliamentary majority, the formation of a government of national unity, a government crisis followed by the dissolution of the Chambers, or the organization of early elections – it is indisputable that in this tragic period Italy is going through, there has been a surprise called Giuseppe Conte.",0
489,Feedzai grows +44% in the first half of the fiscal year and strengthens its C-suite,"H1 growth above target amid the COVID-19 pandemic and market uncertainty. Multiple multi-year enterprise contracts negotiated during the lockdown

New Chief Financial Officer and Chief Marketing Officer join the company

26% of the revenue invested in R&D and 10 patents filed in H1 2020

Feedzai, the world’s leading risk management platform, announced today that its Q2 2020 has been one of the most successful ever from a new business generated perspective. The company has experienced a +44% growth in new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in H1 2020 when compared to H1 2019. A very successful renewal cycle and new large-enterprise deals closed in the US, EMEA, APAC, and LATAM, made the first half of the year a success.

Feedzai currently protects companies with more than 800 million customers in 190 countries. With more than 154M US individual and business taxpayers, almost half of the UK and Canada’s population, and 60% of global music streaming subscriptions being monitored and protected by Feedzai, the company has shown over the years that its mission-critical technology is preferred by the largest and most innovative companies in the world.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Feedzai has seen an increase in financial crime, particularly mule accounts, phishing attacks, employer fraud, and a big spike in fraudulent activity related to online commerce in which people had to significantly rely on during the lockdown.

“Fraudsters thrive on periods of confusion and chaos, and this pandemic represents fertile breeding ground. While many bank capital investments are on hold amidst the economic uncertainty, we are seeing that solutions like Feedzai’s, which reduce fraud losses, decrease operational expense, and improve customer experience through more efficient detection routines are actually seeing increased prioritization for funding, given the increased urgency to protect digital channel transactions in a customer-friendly manner,” says Julie Convoy, Research Director at Aite.

“Feedzai had one of its best quarters ever amid the pandemic, while many industries, unfortunately, showed signs of deterioration. This simultaneously shows that our technology is mission-critical, and our business is crisis resilient,” said Nuno Sebastiao, Co-founder, and CEO of Feedzai. “I’m confident that our next phase of growth will benefit from market conditions in which digital transformation will play a larger than ever role, and from a set of strategic decisions we’ve made in the last 9 months.”

As part of the growth, Feedzai has achieved several important milestones, including:

Business Performance – Feedzai reports a +44% growth in H1 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The company has also seen Q2 2020 growth above target amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to one of its best quarters ever from a new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).

C-suite Strengthening – the company has defined a combination of strategic hires and internal promotions to prepare the organization for the next level of growth

Amaury Dauge, Chief Financial Officer – joins Feedzai after several C-level roles at Qontigo and previous experience as the CFO of Euronext, the 6th largest stock exchange in the world

Varun Kohli, Chief Marketing Officer – a seasoned Silicon Valley executive, who has been part of multiple multi-billion dollar exits (8 out of 9 companies he worked at either went IPO or were acquired)

Richard Harris, EVP of Global Sales – a veteran in both the finance and technology industries, steps in to spearhead the global sales operation after 5 very successful years at Feedzai where he led international operations. Prior to that, Harris held leadership positions at Visa, Experian, and American Express

Pedro Barata, SVP of Product – after 10 years at Feedzai – hired as one of the first employees of the company – Barata becomes the new product leader after successfully building from scratch the entire Customer Success operation

Geographic Expansion and Strategic Deals – Feedzai has closed deals during H1 in all of the regions it is currently operating in – US, EMEA, APAC, and LATAM – and was able to negotiate multi-year contracts with some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world (e.g. one of the biggest payments processors in the world, one of the top 3 banks in Brazil, one of the big four banks in Australia, the largest national card processor in Europe, and several others).

Cutting-Edge technology – Feedzai continues to pave the way with the most advanced, and promising machine learning techniques built to better protect customers and businesses all over the world. The company also keeps protecting its growing Intellectual Property portfolio with 6 new patents filed in the first half of the year around Deep Learning, Model Fairness Optimization, Active Learning, Transaction Graph Representations, and more. Feedzai will also invest around 26% of its revenue in R&D by the end of 2020, while the average investment made by successful SaaS companies sits at 23%.",0
78,Boris Johnson scraps foreign aid department to end Britain’s role as a ‘giant cashpoint in the sky’,"BORIS Johnson has scrapped the foreign aid department to end the UK role of being a ""cashpoint in the sky"".

The Prime Minister confirmed the move today, which will see the Department for International Development merge with the Foreign Office.

The aid department will be officially scrapped by September, and the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will run it.

But Britain will still spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on international aid.

This means Britain will continue to spend it's £14billion aid budget.

Mr Johnson told MPs the plans would save money.

He said: ""The UK possesses the third biggest aid budget and diplomatic network in the world.
“We owe it to our people to make best use of these assets.

""For too long frankly UK overseas aid has been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests or to the values the UK wishes to express or the priorities diplomatic political or commercial of the Government of the UK.

“The British taxpayer has a right to expect that we will achieve the maximum value for every pound that we spend.""

It comes as:

Boris Johnson was forced into a u-turn on free school meals today and announced he would fund them for kids throughout the summer holidays
The true coronavirus death toll surpassed 53,000 - 11,000 more than the official figure

Mr Johnson told the Commons the new arrangements would help ""maximise British interests"".

He said: ""I have decided to merge DfID with the Foreign and Commonwealth office to create a new department - the Foreign Commonwealth and development office.
""This will unite aid with diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort.

""It makes no sense to ask whether this amounts to aid or foreign policy - they are one and the same endeavour and are designed to attain the same goals which are right in themselves and serve the same goals.""

The PM also vowed the revamp will be used to make sure British companies get a “fair crack of the whip” when competing for aid contracts.

It follows a review into UK aid spending by crossbench peer Lord Bew.

The Bew review assessed the UK's £14 billion aid budget as part of a review of how the UK interacts with the world.

Boris said that the merger is an opportunity for the UK to have ""even greater impact and influence on the world stage"" as Britain prepares to hold the G7 presidency and host COP26 next year.

The Department for International Development will now join with the FCO, with both sharing ministers since the February reshuffle.

Anne-Marie Trevelyan will remain International Development Secretary for the next few months - but it's not clear whether she will have a job after that.

There are no plans for a second Secretary of State or a Deputy Foreign Secretary.

Tory MP Shailesh Vara labelled it a ""good decision"".

He added: ""Ministers in both departments already have joint responsibility and it makes sense to have unified strategic planning"".
And Michael Fabricant MP tweeted: ""I'm glad Boris has shown the agility and flexibility to Merge the Foreign Office and International Development Department into a Super-Department which integrates international policy & reflects our role as a Global Britain.""

James Roberts, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said:

""This shift is good news for taxpayers, but it's crucial that the end result is less of their money being wasted.

“Taxpayers must get the maximum possible value for every pound spent. For too long, cash has been thrown away by DfID on ineffective and unjustified projects - money must now go to those most in need, at home and abroad.""

More could and should be done to co-ordinate aid and foreign policy, including through the National Security Council, but the end of @DFID_UK will mean less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas. 2/2

— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) June 16, 2020

But the decision was immediately attacked by former PM David Cameron, who said it was a ""mistake"".

He tweeted: ""The end of DIFD will mean less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas.""

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also blasted the merger.

Labour's Sir Keir Starmer hit out at the decision, labelling DfID as one of the ""best performing and important departments.""

He added: ""Labour created DfID, and I am proud of that.

""Abolishing DfID abolishes Britain’s place in the world.

""The PM should stop these distractions and get on with tackling the health and economic crisis we currently face.""

The SNP's Ian Blackford said the PM was using the merger as an ""excuse to wind down aid"" for those who needed it most.

International NGO Health Poverty Action hit out at the merger.

Director Martin Drewry said: ""Absorbing DfID into the Foreign Office adds insult to injury for the world’s poorest people.

""It will increase inequality further by using aid, and therefore the lives of people around the world, as a bargaining chip for serving corporate and political interests.”

The merger is understood to be backed by both permanent secretaries in the departments, and all staff meeting is understood to have been called in the Foreign Office for Wednesday.

Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat welcomed the merger “if it maintains technical expertise that DfID demonstrates around the world"".

He said “I’ve long been calling for proper integration of the UK’s foreign policy to achieve the strategic outcomes, not just for ourselves but also our friends and partners"".

Britain's foreign aid budget has faced constant scrutiny, with the PM under pressure last year after it emerged China and India received £151million in UK cash - a rise of 12 per cent.

The British taxpayer donated £70,315 to a Chinese project to encourage shoppers not to buy products made with pangolins, an endangered species whose scales are used in traditional medicines, while its meat is a high-end delicacy.

Meanwhile £20,062 of aid was spent on looking at how solar panels could power India’s railways.

Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, said giving taxpayers’ cash to China had brought the spending into “disrepute”.

He said: “Spending hardearned taxpayers’ money in China, a country powering out of poverty and attaining superpower status brings Britain’s brilliant development work into disrepute.""

But the former DfID boss branded the merger a “quite extraordinary mistake” that will “destroy a key aspect of Global Britain”.

Figures show that the UK provided £1 in every £8 of foreign aid handed out by 29 major countries in £2018.

The Sun Says

WE welcome the news that the Prime Minister is to fold the aid department into the Foreign Office.

Having a department specifically for “international development” might sound virtuous, but it makes no sense.

The Foreign Office, which is in charge of building relationships with foreign countries, is perfectly placed to spend our aid money where it counts.

If it had been in charge all along, our whopping aid budget would most likely have been used to fund valuable projects in fast-developing African countries — natural allies for Britain post Brexit.

Thanks to the rudderless Department for International Development, it’s been squandered on things like upgrading roads in India — an enormously rich country with a fleet of new warships and a space programme to boot.

The Sun is all for helping the genuinely needy. But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits.

If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.",0
467,Fighting piracy in the Gulf of Guinea needs a radical rethink,"The Bonita had been anchored off Benin for several days, waiting for a berth in the port of Cotonou. On November 2, 2019 the crew had a traumatic awakening. Armed men boarded the vessel and kidnapped nine crew members. Only two days later, four seafarers were kidnapped from the Elka Aristotle, which was anchored off Lomé in neighbouring Togo.

Unfortunately, these were not the only attacks off the coast of West Africa in which seafarers were kidnapped. Nevertheless, the patterns are changing, with gradual signs of improvement. In addition, attacker success rates in the region have declined from 80% over ten years ago to just under 50% in 2018.

Another change has been the fact that attacks have become more visible. This is at least partly due to increased cooperation among countries in West and Central Africa. They adopted the Yaoundé Code of Conduct in 2013, aimed at fighting illicit activities at sea. Implementation has been slow, yet navies and maritime agencies in the region have become much more active in collecting relevant information.

Based on my research into maritime security in the region, I have become increasingly convinced that sustainable improvements are impossible when the focus is solely on piracy. In many cases, kidnappings of seafarers are an extension of land-based problems – such as fuel smuggling and illegal migration – and have to be tackled as such.

In my view, demands by the shipping industry for international navies to become more involved in counter-piracy operations won’t lead to lasting solutions. These can only be successful if they are designed based on regional requirements and take on board regional initiatives aimed at tackling a multiplicity of social problems, rather than just one.

Links to crime on land

High-profile attacks – such as the recent kidnappings – are generally carried out by criminal groups based in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region.

Kidnappings on land have been a long-standing problem for security forces there. Collecting ransoms has become a lucrative business model which requires foot soldiers, access to camps for holding hostages, and negotiators with the necessary skills. All these things can be found in the Niger Delta, where the lines between armed insurgents and organised criminals are often fluid.

For countries like Benin, Togo and Cameroon where Nigeria-based criminals have taken hostages from merchant ships this year, the situation is a concern. Ports in these countries are crucial for economic growth and development in terms of customs revenues. For example, more than 40% of Benin’s government revenues are collected in Cotonou’s port. Ensuring adequate security for maritime trade is therefore a strategic concern in Benin. Hence the government’s quick announcement of improved security measures for ships anchoring off Cotonou.

Most kidnappings still take place off the Nigerian coastline. The established pattern is one of hostages being taken and then released several weeks later for a ransom payment. This is according to analysis done by the Danish security intelligence company Risk Intelligence.

The fact that there are more cases off the Nigerian coastline points to my contention that this criminal behaviour is closely linked to land-based criminal activities – such as fuel smuggling – which is widespread in the area.

When such incidents are analysed through a narrow piracy lens, efforts of navies and law enforcement agencies -– which are already suffering from a lack of resources –- are likely to be misguided. The narrow view might mistakenly focus, for example, on the capacity to respond at sea.

The problem of wrong analyses is made worse by international actors, for example the US and European governments, the European Union or international organisations. They often put a strong emphasis on combating piracy and provide financial or technical assistance to partners in West and Central Africa. But they rarely focus on illegal fishing, fuel smuggling or illegal migration. All these activities have been linked to attacks against merchant ships or fishing vessels.

Broader understanding needed

Fighting piracy in the Gulf of Guinea requires a broad understanding of maritime security. Acknowledging links between, for example, piracy and illegal fishing is vital for regional governments and external partners. On the most basic level, illegal fishing destroys fishers’ livelihoods, forcing some into piracy simply to earn an income.

A good example is the EU’s contradictory stance. On the one hand, it provides €29 million to support West Africa’s Integrated Maritime Security project. On the other hand, EU countries contribute to the depletion of fish stocks across West Africa.

Countries around the Gulf of Guinea also have to increase their efforts. Laws regulating maritime operations are often deliberately opaque, disguising a lack of enforcement capacity and enabling corruption. Increasing transparency would highlight shortcomings and problems caused by insecurity at sea –- somewhat embarrassing for any government, but necessary to address these issues.

Recent efforts in Nigeria, including a large conference in October that led to the Abuja Declaration, are a step in the right direction. The declaration highlighted shortcomings of countries around the Gulf of Guinea related to ocean governance and law enforcement at sea. Concrete actions have to follow.

More transparency could also help to improve relationships between the maritime industry and security agencies in the region. Lack of trust and limited cooperation have often hindered thorough investigations, feeding a simple narrative of piracy without a broader look at other maritime security challenges.",0
165,Anti-terror groups reject federal grants in opposition to Donald Trump administration’s ‘Muslim travel ban’,"The Obama administration in its final days awarded 31 grants through the Homeland Security Department worth a total of about $10 million. Those agreements haven't been signed, and no money has been distributed.

Now, two groups are rejecting the money they already had been offered, while others have objected to Trump's plans.

Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities in Dearborn, Michigan, said it was turning down $500,000 for youth development and public health programmes because of the “current political climate.”

Ka Joog, a leading Somali non-profit in Minneapolis, rejected nearly $500,000 for its youth programmes. “Our nation's new administration and their policies which promote hate, fear, uncertainty and even worse; an unofficial war on Muslim-Americans and immigrants,” the group said in a statement.

The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to email and phone requests for comment from The Associated Press.

Trump has endorsed extreme vetting and ordered a temporary ban on refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Charities that already have worked with US government agencies, including the CIA, Justice Department and Homeland Security Department, said they were reacting to discussions within the Trump administration to exclusively target “radical Islamic terrorists” under a US programme to counter violent extremism, known as CVE.

A US official with knowledge of the discussions said the Trump administration has been discussing changing the Obama administration programme's name, established as a presidential strategy in 2011, to some iteration of “countering Islamic extremism.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorised to speak publicly.

Most of the 31 federal grants were promised to municipalities, but some were directed to non-profit groups such as Life After Hate Inc. in Chicago, which received $400,000 for its work with former white supremacists - a large portion of which will also go to a partner group to work with individuals inspired by al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group.

The US official said it was unclear whether a group such as Life After Hate would continue to receive funding or be included in any future programme.

Christian Picciolini, the co-founder of Life After Hate and a former white supremacist, said such a change would be troubling and “sends a message that white extremism does not exist, or is not a priority in our country, when in fact it is a statistically larger and more present terror threat than any by foreign or other domestic actors.”

White supremacist groups saw renewed interest during the presidential campaign, which many credited to Trump's candidacy. Picciolini said that since his group had not received its funding yet, “I suppose it's possible it could be rescinded altogether.”

The non-profit Washington-based Muslim Public Affairs Council had encouraged the Muslim community to give the programme countering violent extremism a chance.

Council President Salam Al-Marayati said Thursday, “If there's a policy change that basically in effect tells us we have to fight our own religion, then this is a fundamental violation of our constitutional rights and we will consider all possible actions for redress.”

Still, Al-Marayati said there is such disarray throughout federal agencies that “nobody knows where this is going.”

“With this toxic vitriol coming out of the White House... this administration may undermine everything we've been working on for the last 10 years,” Al-Marayati said.

Since 2014, when pilot programmes under CVE were announced by the Obama administration, US officials have worked to convince the American Muslim community that the programme was not just about them.

Suehaila Amen, a director for Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities, said its members voted unanimously January 26 to reject the funds and were influenced by recent discussions of a possible name change.

“What's most important is we protect our community and their needs and concerns,” she said. “Our patriotism isn't tied to a grant, and at the end of the day we need to continue to serve our community (and) ensure transparency and trust, and we're not willing to compromise that.”

Amen, who worked with the Bush and Obama administrations to help build outreach to minority groups, said she told US officials this past week that she will no longer be participating in discussions around countering violent extremism with the Trump administration.

Jihad Turk, the founding president of the Islamic graduate school Bayan Claremont in California, said its board would review the language of its $800,000 award before accepting to make sure it doesn't place additional restrictions or impositions on them.

He said the problem with making the programme focus on “Islamic extremism” is that “there's nothing illegal about an extreme interpretation of your religion.”

“What's illegal is terrorism,” he said, and that's why the word “violent” is key.

John Cohen, a former DHS official who helped write the CVE strategy and led its implementation, said it specifically didn't target extremists inspired by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, because local law enforcement said white supremacist and other extremist groups were more problematic and targeted communities and police.

He criticised the programme for focusing too much on Muslim and Arab communities since he left in 2014, and called on Trump to dump his campaign language from any re-imagining of CVE or risk driving “an even greater wedge between those responsible for stopping violent attacks and those within the community who are critical partners in effectively doing that.”",0
574,EU removes east Libya powerbroker Aguila Saleh from sanctions blacklist,"The European Union has removed an east Libyan powerbroker from its sanctions blacklist to encourage peace efforts and ensure the EU plays a central role in any negotiated settlement in Libya.

The EU said on Friday that Aguila Saleh, leader of a rival parliament in eastern Libya, no longer faces EU travel bans and asset freezes imposed four years ago.

The body also removed measures against Nuri Abusahmain, the former president of the Tripoli-based General National Congress, which lost international recognition in 2014.

""The delisting of Speaker Saleh was agreed in light of his recent constructive engagement in support of a negotiated political solution to the Libyan crisis,"" the EU said in a statement.

""The Council will continue to follow his behaviour closely, notably in relation to his support for the Berlin Process and for the efforts of the UN mission to Libya (UNSMIL).

Read More »

""The delisting of Abu Sahmain was agreed based on the overall absence of any recent role in the Libyan political process.""

Libya descended into chaos after a Nato-backed uprising toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Rival governments in the east and the west have been competing for legitimacy with eastern commander Khalifa Haftar seeking military control of the whole country.

Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army controls most of eastern Libya, but has faced military setbacks since he started a campaign late last year to capture the capital Tripoli from the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).

Saleh is seen as a counterweight to Haftar in the east. In June, Turkish envoy for Libya Emrullah Isler told MEE that Ankara prefers to negotiate with Saleh rather than Haftar.

""Haftar is a failed dictator and we have never recognised him as a legitimate actor. He is also about to lose Russian support. He won't take a place in the future of Libya,"" Isler said at the time.

""Political negotiations should be conducted by the politicians. Aguila Saleh Issa, as a politician, specifically must contribute to this process.""

Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Russia, while Turkey supports the GNA and its allies in Tripoli.

The EU officially backs the UN-recognised government, but some European states, including France, have been accused of supporting Haftar.",0

376,Swedish banks join forces to fight money laundering,"Danske Bank, Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank are onboard for the Swedish Anti Money Laundering Initiative (Samlit), which will begin life as a pilot project ahead of a full launch next year.

Under Samlit, the banks will be able to collectively share information on methods, suspicious transaction patterns and new types of crime that have been jointly identified.

Johanna Norberg, country manager, Danske Bank Sweden, says: ""Like a chameleon, this type of crime is constantly changing form and pattern, so for us, this collaboration means increased efficiency and proactivity.""

In March, Sweden’s FSA fined Swedbank a record $385 million over breaches in its anti-money laundering work.",0
221,"Spared the auction block for now, Islamic museum’s artifacts face unclear future","The kerfuffle over a planned sale at Sotheby’s of part of the collection from Jerusalem’s Museum of Islamic Art has resulted in the sale being postponed until November. But as some push for the auction to be scrapped altogether, others are demanding that it go ahead as planned.

One hundred and ninety objects of Islamic art from The L.A. Mayer Museum for Islamic Art’s storage and 60 clocks and watches from its permanent collection were scheduled to be sold on October 27 and 28. The museum had said that facing financial pressures, especially from the coronavirus pandemic, it was forced to sell off the items, in order to remain open at all.

Two days before the planned sale, President Reuven Rivlin said the State of Israel must find the means to prevent the sale of the cultural assets.

“We must do all we can to keep them in Israel,” said Rivlin, whose official residence is up the block from the museum.

The private Hermann de Stern Foundation based in Liechtenstein, which provides most of the financial support for the museum, asked Sotheby’s to postpone the sale, due to its great respect for Rivlin.

But the Israeli attorney for the Hermann de Stern Foundation, Zvi Agmon, vehemently refuted the need to postpone the sale.

“I respect the president and I told my client we have to respect what he’s saying, so we decided to postpone,” he said. “But the museum can do this [sale]. The director isn’t going to spend it in Las Vegas, he’s trying to make plans for the museum.”

The museum notified the government of the sale in August, “but they only woke up in October,” said Agmon, noting that the museum’s planned sale at Sotheby’s was in full compliance with Israeli law.

“Museums sell items, sometimes in order to buy something new or to do something for the museum. It’s part of the balancing act of museums throughout the world,” said Agmon. “No one is letting anything escape.”

The question remains as to why the foundation — set up with monies from the Stern family, known as one of the richest Jewish families in Victorian England, can’t help the museum — said one UK watch collector who preferred to remain anonymous.

“They were so rich, they lent money to governments,” said the collector. “Maybe the foundation is really short of money. It seems unlikely.”

According to the museum’s financial holdings, available on the Justice Ministry website for nonprofit organizations, its annual turnover in 2018 was NIS 8,964,716, with government support and admission sales accounting for one-fifth of its annual income.

The sale of Islamic works, including objects, manuscripts and rugs and carpets, is estimated to bring in between $4.13 million and $6.1 million. The watches, which were to be offered on the auction’s second day, have a combined estimated worth of $2.2 million-$3.4 million.

The museum put extreme care into the selection process, with the guiding principle to ensure that the integrity of museum’s collection remain intact, said a Sotheby’s spokesperson.

The vast majority of works selected for sale came from storage, representing a small percentage of total holdings, which number 5,000.

“Our mutual goal was to secure the future of the museum and enable them to achieve the extremely worthwhile projects that they have planned,” said the Sotheby’s spokesperson.

The sale proceeds will be used to expand the museum’s intercultural programs, including tours for schools, Arabic lessons for Hebrew speakers and exhibitions of Arab Israeli art, which were all part of the founding vision of Vera Salomons, whose mother was Laura Stern, a descendent of the Stern banking family, and whose father, David Salomons, was a scientific author and horologist who amassed the world’s largest Breguet watch collection.

His collection has been on display at the museum since its establishment.

“To carry a fine Breguet watch is to feel that you have the brains of a genius in your pocket,” is an oft-mentioned quote of Salomons.

Several UK watch collectors and experts expressed dismay that three of the museum’s Breguet watches, considered to be among the finest examples of precision micro mechanical engineering technology of the 19th century, were being put up for sale.

The top lots of the watch sale, three Breguet pocket watches, have a mythical provenance, according to Sotheby’s. The three timepieces present the French watchmaker’s mechanical genius and revolutionary inventions, and include a watch made for the future King George IV of the United Kingdom, estimated at $514,000-$771,000, and a thermometer watch made for Princess Caroline Murat, Napoleon Bonaparte’s sister, estimated at $381,831-$254,554.

For horologists, it’s extremely rare to have three complicated Breguet watches coming under the hammer at the same time.

“I was a bit shocked that a watch of this caliber was up for grabs,” said Dr. Andrew Hildreth, Watch Editor at I-M Intelligent Magazine and Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers. “To me, it predates and prefixes a number of developments in the modern watch world.”

“A demonstration of his art”. Pocket watch no. 2788 was, according to George Daniels, an example of Breguet’s theory of dynamics as applied to oscillating bodies. Breguet had laid out the principles in an unpublished manuscript. Breguet was also the first to implement the idea in a watch, and this example was very much experimental. Watch no. 2788 was originally started in 1812, completed about six years later, and sold in 1818 to the Prince Regent (later becoming George IV) for £350. Astoundingly that would be approximately £30000 in today’s money. Part of the Royal household that championed John Harrison’s cause. What makes this watch fascinating is the fact that the movements are geared with their own seconds hands, with spiral balance springs with terminal curves, free sprung. As viewed from the back of the watch, the movement to the left side/right side of the dial has subsidiary seconds, while the movement to the right/left side of the dial incorporates the centre seconds. There is no regulation to the balances as, according to George Daniels it “was essential if the effect of the vibration was to be fully transmitted to the cock”. However, it is obvious that Daniels learned and was inspired by Breguet from this watch. Not just the design and form of the dial, the architecture of the movement, that informed George’s Space Traveller watches and the independent double-wheel escapement, but also the experimental nature of the watch. In the same manner as Daniels created each of his pocket watches: to explore some aspect of horology. Both watchmakers influenced @fpjourneofficial in both movement form and belief of what could be achieved with independent watchmaking. Provenance is just about as perfect as you could hope for. Formerly part of the collection of Sir David Salomons and then the L.A. Mayer Memorial Institute, Jerusalem (inventory no. WA 76-71). It is also highly likely that this watch was also once the (illegally obtained) property of Na’aman Diller who took possession on April 15, 1983 and had it returned some 25 years later. Truly an amazing watch in terms of horological history. Lot 205 at @sothebyswatches next week.

A post shared by Dr. Andrew K. G. Hildreth (@dr.andrew_hildreth) on Oct 22, 2020 at 6:09am PDT

If the museum goes ahead with the sale, Hildreth hopes it would go to a collector who would put it on public display.

He was also surprised at the “ridiculously low price,” comparing it with similar watches that have been sold for mid-seven figures.

“There’s sufficient money in the world and I have to think that it would go for five or ten times this,” he said. “These kinds of watches should not be in private hands.”",0

577,Legislators Push For Stronger Hate Crime Law,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers is proposing a bill to strengthen Kentucky’s hate crime law.

The legislation comes in reaction to the killings of two Black people at a Jeffersontown Kroger in 2018.

The alleged shooter, Gregory Bush, is facing state murder charges and federal hate crime charges. Kentucky’s hate crime law doesn’t currently apply to murder.

The new proposal would improve on the current law, according to Sen. Gerald Neal, a Democrat from Louisville.

“It’s got teeth in it, it has the ability to render justice in this situation and to send a strong signal to our community that we do not condone or accept hate in our community,” Neal said.

Kentucky’s current hate crime law only applies to some offenses, like rape, assault, kidnapping, arson and rioting.

During the sentencing process, a court can enhance penalties if it’s proven that the crime was committed based on race, color, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

The new bill would add murder as a possible hate crime and increase penalties for other offenses. Class A or B misdemeanors would be increased by at least half of the maximum imprisonment sentence and fine that currently exist.

Class D felonies would increase prison terms by one to five years, Class C felonies would increase by 5 to 10 years and Class A and B felonies would increase by 10 to 20 years.

Sen. Julie Raque Adams, a Republican from Louisville, said it’s appropriate to take up the bill after months of protests over racial justice.

“I think it’s fantastic we are having this conversation. We’ve had months and months of social unrest and racial unrest, and I think people want to see something happen,” Raque Adams said.

The lawmakers unveiled the bill in Louisville on Friday along with family members of Vickie Jones and Maurice Stallard, who were killed at the Jeffersontown Kroger in 2018.

Kellie Watson, the daughter of Stallard, said stronger policies are needed to protect victims of hate crimes.

“You know with everything that you see within our city and within this country today. It leaves me feeling sad and tired and frustrated and overwhelmed,” Watson said.

“But at the same time I’m also hopeful and faithful that maybe this will lead to something different, and this legislation can be the beginning of that.”",0
27,"In war-torn Syria, the coronavirus pandemic has brought its people to the brink of starvation","Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may have successfully warded off a nine-year rebellion against his government, but he is being tested with economic turmoil and civilian protests amid the coronavirus pandemic and looming conflict in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

The civil war in Syria has been overshadowed as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and its grim economic and social ramifications.

In March 2020, before the pandemic’s first wave reached its peak, the war was in full swing. Turkey and Russia locked horns over the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib, the last stronghold of the Syrian opposition. There were fears Turkey would actively fight the Syrian government.

As predicted, a last-minute deal was struck when Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan visited his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow in March 2020.

The deal established a security corridor 6 kilometres each side of Idlib’s M4 motorway. This is a key route linking Aleppo and Latakia, two major cities held by the Syrian government, which also retained its territorial gains during the crisis with Turkey.

Civil war takes a break amid the pandemic

Since March, there has not been any significant development in the Syrian conflict, which has been largely driven by the Syrian government’s offensive since it captured Aleppo in 2016. Opposition has been largely eliminated, with those remaining in Idlib seemingly happy to be on the defensive rather than launch any offensive to the Russian-supplied Assad forces.

There are several reasons why the Assad government has just about halted its offensive. These include the coronavirus pandemic, the impact of the economic turmoil in Lebanon, and the economic and political crisis within Syria. Moreover, Turkey, a key player in Syria, has been busy in the eastern Mediterranean.

On March 30, the first coronavirus-related death was reported in Syria. There were fears the virus could spread rapidly through the highly vulnerable 6.6 million people displaced by the conflict, now living in overcrowded camps.

As the coronavirus spread deep into the country, the Syrian government introduced several measures to halt its progress. Borders were closed, travel between rural and urban areas was restricted, schools and restaurants were shut, and a nationwide curfew was implemented between 7.30pm and 6am. The effectiveness of these measures was highly uncertain.

Official reports suggest Syria is doing well, with 160 deaths and 3,614 cases at the time of writing. But, as with many authoritarian countries, these figures seem too low, given the conditions in the country.

In April, testing was as low as 100 a day, with half of those in the capital, Damascus. By August, that had risen to 300 a day in only five testing centres. Of the reported cases, a mere 500 are from government-controlled regions. Syria as a whole has reported far fewer cases than any other Middle Eastern country.

It is almost certain the numbers of coronavirus cases are grossly under-reported. The deputy director for health in Damascus estimates the real number is 112,500 cases in Damascus alone. Poorly equipped hospitals are running out of supplies and, unfortunately, body bags.

Economic meltdown and civil unrest

There is a reason for the under-reporting of coronavirus cases in Syria: the economic turmoil that is facing the country and threatening the Assad government far more than the years of armed rebellion.

In late April, the government began lifting some coronavirus restrictions, but these measures caused panic-buying and sharp increases in food prices. This was compounded by a rapid fall in the value of the Syrian pound, which traded at 3,000 to the US dollar on the black market (as opposed to 47 to the dollar before the civil war).

Inevitably, coronavirus measures have had a major economic impact on the war-torn country. The cost of living in Syria has increased by more than 100% year on year.

The economic crisis was deepened by the increasing US sanctions. New sanctions introduced in June target any foreign person who has knowingly provided significant financial, material, or technological support to the government of Syria.

Further, the worst economic meltdown in Lebanon since the 1975-90 civil war caused a further slump in the Syrian economy.

The compounding effect of these forces culminated in rare civilian protests in the Syrian capital. The protests began with economic demands but quickly turned into clashes, with supporters of Iran-backed Hezbollah calling for the downfall of the Assad government.

The government was not the only target of public anger. More than 80% of Syrians live below the poverty line. The economic crisis hit the opposition-controlled city of Idlib, leading to demonstrations against the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.

Many Syrians are in desperate circumstances. The pandemic has wiped out what meagre income they had, and they face mass starvation. The likely result is another mass exodus to Europe through Turkey.

Repercussions of Syrian conflict in eastern Mediterranean

The current crisis in the eastern Mediterranean is seemingly the result of dispute between two NATO allies, Greece and Turkey, over Turkey’s exploration of natural gas in waters claimed by Greece. There are three reasons why it has repercussions for the Syrian conflict.

First, Turkey is drifting away from the western and European bloc over its assertive Syria policy (and Erdogan’s authoritarian tendencies within Turkey). Turkey was at odds with the US and European countries over its military operations and Syrian refugee policy, which allowed a flood of refugees to cross into Europe. In doing so, Turkey grew closer to Russia and, to some extent, Iran.

The second is the uncertainty of the US policy on Syria and the US pulling out of Syria under the Trump administration. This resulted in Russia dominating the course of the Syrian civil war. Meanwhile, developments in the eastern Mediterranean forced European powers, particularly France, to step in to fill the void.

The third is Greece’s attempt to bolster its own diplomatic and economic interests by leveraging against Turkey’s alienation from its western allies. This is aided by the conflict between Turkey and Egypt over Turkey’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood.

In early 2020, Greece signed a major 1,900 kilometre undersea pipeline deal with Israel and Cyprus, followed by a bilateral defence deal with France. Greece expanded its diplomatic push by signing an agreement with Egypt “designating an exclusive economic zone in the eastern Mediterranean‮‮ ‬‬between the two countries, an area containing promising oil and gas reserves”.

Unprepared, Turkey felt trapped, flexing its military muscles in unilateral moves in the Mediterranean Sea. French President Emmanuel Macron responded saying Turkey is “no longer a partner” in the region, further escalating tensions.

Russia has so far stayed quiet on the eastern Mediterranean crisis. But a dispute between Turkey, Greece and other NATO countries will further alienate Turkey within NATO, resulting in a stronger position for Russia and its military and political base in Syria.

The coronavirus and its repercussions may have contributed to the slowing of civil war in Syria, but the humanitarian crisis facing its people may yet grow even worse.",0
261,Whole Foods reverses ban on veteran poppies after backlash in Canada,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O upscale grocer Whole Foods Market said on Friday it had reversed a decision banning its employees from sporting poppy flowers, a symbolic gesture to honour Remembrance Day, following a backlash in Canada.

The move to ban the poppy led to criticism by many on social media, with Canadians expressing their feelings by taking to Twitter with the hashtag “#LestWeForget”.

“Our new unified dress code policy is intended to create consistency and ensure operational safety across all of our stores,” a Whole Foods spokesperson said, adding that it was never the intention to single out “the poppy or to suggest a lack of support for Remembrance Day”.

The poppy is a symbol used by Commonwealth countries to recognise the sacrifice made by armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. Remembrance Day is commemorated on Nov. 11 each year.

“I think Whole Foods has made a silly mistake that I am hoping they will correct very quickly,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa on Friday.

Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay has been in direct touch with the company to “highlight that they made a mistake and should change course,” Trudeau added.

Whole Foods was sued in July by employees accusing the grocery chain of punishing workers who wear “Black Lives Matter” face masks on the job. The company had then said the masks violated its longstanding dress code banning clothing with “visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising” unrelated to the company.",0
348,Kanye West's strange presidential bid unravels thanks to a messy ballot access operation,"(CNN) Kanye West is on the ballot in Minnesota and Tennessee but just missed the filing deadline in Wisconsin. Missouri said his petition lacked more than 3,400 valid signatures, but he's gone to court in a last-ditch attempt to get on the ballot in the swing state of Ohio.

He's also blown past the first deadline to tell federal regulators how he's using campaign money and has only hit the campaign trail for a rally once. But in Arizona, one of the last remaining presidential battlegrounds where he could still qualify for the ballot, the West campaign is gathering signatures.

A little more than two months before Election Day, rapper-producer West's attention-grabbing presidential bid is bumping along in fits and starts -- dogged by repeated questions about the campaign's tactics, the candidate's mental health and whether his quasi-candidacy represents little more than an underhanded effort by Republican operatives to capitalize on West's celebrity in an attempt to siphon Black support from Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

The 43-year-old music and fashion mogul and his running mate, Wyoming-based spiritual life coach Michelle Tidball, have no chance of winning the White House. A CNN tally shows he had made it onto the ballot in just 11 states as of Monday -- where a total of 83 electoral votes are at stake, well short of the 270 needed for presidency.

But he has persisted in his quest to mount an independent bid -- aided at every turn by Republican figures, some with close ties to President Donald Trump.

In Ohio, Curt Hartman, the Cincinnati lawyer representing West in the lawsuit the campaign filed this week to get on the Ohio ballot, served as a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention and is the Republican nominee for a county judicial seat. Hartman did not respond to messages.

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has concluded that West's nominating petition and statement of candidacy did not match the petitions that were signed by voters.

His campaign also is suing in Wisconsin, where state election officials concluded West missed the filing deadline. His lawyer in the Wisconsin case, Erick Kaardal, is a former secretary/treasurer of the state Republican Party in neighboring Minnesota.

Asked how he came to represent the West campaign, Kaardal said: ""I've been instructed not to comment.""

Even as some state officials rebuff West's efforts to get on the November ballot, West's campaign continues to push for ballot access in other states.

In Arizona, a presidential battleground where candidates face a September 4 deadline to qualify for the ballot, a signature collector with the West campaign approached students this week on the campus of Arizona State University. In an interview with CNN, a student described one worker as evasive when asked about the candidate's identity.

The West campaign did not response to interview requests this week

Trump campaign aides have denied any effort to coordinate with West, who fervently supported Trump before announcing his own bid in in July.

""I like Kanye very much,"" Trump told reporters earlier this month, but added: ""No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We'll have to see what happens.""

Tactics questioned

West has either missed the deadline, did not file or has had his application denied in 33 states and Washington, DC.

He still has the chance to qualify in six others, including Arizona, where recent polls show Biden and Trump locked in a close race.

Arizona State law student Matt Rein told CNN he was approached earlier this week by a signature gatherer as he walked to class in Phoenix.

Rein said when he asked what the signature was for, the man said only that it would help get an independent candidate on the ballot in Arizona.

After a several follow-up questions from Rein, who is the founder of The Dem Hype House, a hub for liberal discourse on TikTok, Rein said the worker first described the petition as helping Tidball before finally acknowledging Tidball was on the ticket with West.

Rein said he declined to sign and walked away, but the canvasser pursued him, saying that although West was unlikely to prevail, his presence on the ballot could help take away the ""reality star vote"" from Trump.

""He really buried the lead with the whole Kanye thing,"" Rein told CNN. ""It wasn't until I pressed him multiple times, at which point he said it was for Kanye West.""

""At the minimum, it's very shady.""

Rein said several his classmates were also approached to sign petitions this week.

Potential to backfire

Despite the sales pitch by the signature-gatherer in Arizona, most activists on the Democratic side and outside observers doubt West could end up having much of an effect on the race even in the states where his name does end up appearing on the ballot.

An Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted earlier this month showed only 2% of registered voters chose West as their preferred candidate when given the option.

Matt Liebman, president of the Voter Protection Project, a Democratic group, told CNN his organization expects to spend more than $5 million this year on efforts to elect voting rights champions and boost voter turnout in November. The West campaign effort, he said, was likely to fall flat -- whatever its true aims.

""Honestly, Black voters across the country, they're not going to be fooled by this,"" Liebman said.

Liebman suggested that, as voters read and heard more about the controversies surrounding West and allegations of GOP shenanigans, the result could be a net-positive for the Biden campaign.

""I think the Kanye West thing could actually be helpful in the sense that it's bringing more attention to the race and folks are like, 'This is just another crazy tactic,' "" Liebman said. ""It's just another distraction. It's more chaos and I think people are tired, they're tired of the chaos.""

For some Democrats, there are still raw memories of 2016, when they beat Trump in the popular vote but lost the presidency, and 2000, when Ralph Nader ran an independent campaign that many Democrats blamed for undercutting support for former Vice President Al Gore. They fear West's name on the ballot in a swing state could, if the margins are as tight as expected, attract just enough support to tilt the race.

But the political climate in 2020 is very different, noted Robert Shapiro, a professor and former chair of the Department of Political Science at Columbia University, who said that West's campaign is unlikely to attract the disillusioned voters who were drawn to third party candidates four years ago.

""The people who were angry and frustrated and so forth are basically, at the moment, kind of wrapped up more in being either anti-Trump or anti-Democrat,"" Shapiro said. ""And the anti-Democrat people will vote for Trump and the anti-Trump people will vote for the Democrats, because their anger is (directed) that way and not to some general anger, where you say, the hell with it for both parties.""

Shapiro also pointed to West's scattershot political operation and noted that, with a few exceptions, he has not campaigned or engaged with voters -- unlike the more sophisticated and ideologically driven efforts undertaken by Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, in 2016.

""Stein and Johnson, they did the legwork, they put in the time and their supporters put in the time to do what it did. They developed organizations,"" Shapiro said. ""West didn't do that.""

Criticism of Republican efforts to elevate West's candidacy have also focused on the artist's mental health. West has said he's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In a post on Instagram Stories last month, days after West spoke at a campaign event -- a rally in South Carolina -- his wife, Kim Kardashian West, addressed some of those concerns -- and her own.

""(Kanye) is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder,"" she wrote. ""Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.""

Anthony Robinson, political director for the National Democratic Training Committee, accused Republicans encouraging West's campaign of doing damage that would last beyond November.

""Where will Kanye stand at the end of this? Where will the culture stand at the end of this? Where will the African American electorate stand at the end of it?,"" Robinson said. ""I think that's what the greater damage is.""

Missed filing deadline

West's campaign did not join other presidential contenders who filed campaign reports on August 20 with the Federal Election Commission -- indicating what his campaign had raised and spent in July.

Under federal law, presidential candidates must file monthly reports in an election year if they have raised or spent $100,000 -- or anticipate doing so during the course of the year, said Paul Ryan, an election law expert who oversees policy and litigation at Common Cause.

And West appears to have been spending heavily early on.

On July 15 -- the same day he filed paperwork announcing his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission -- West paid a $35,000 filing fee to get on the ballot in Oklahoma, according to the Misha Mohr, the spokeswoman for the Oklahoma State Election Board.

The Federal Election Commission currently lacks a quorum to pursue any enforcement actions. And Ryan said it's difficult to prove what a campaign anticipated spending, although the agency could subpoena records to determine whether West already had plans to exceed the $100,000-threshold by signing contracts in July for future work, such as petition-gathering.

The bigger legal jeopardy might be for the Trump campaign if evidence ever emerged that they operated in concert with West to benefit the President's reelection, Ryan said.

""If the Trump campaign is asking Kayne West to do these things -- qualify for the ballot, etc. -- then arguably the Trump campaign is soliciting an illegally large, in-kind contributions to the Trump campaign in the form of every penny Kanye West spends,"" he said.

On Friday, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh responded: ""We have no idea what Kanye West is doing or who is helping him do it.""

295,Anti-money laundering software startup TookiTaki raises $11.7 million in additional Series A funding,"TookiTaki, a startup that develops machine learning-based financial compliance software, announced today it has raised a $11.7 million in additional Series A funding, led by Viola Fintech and SIG Asia Investment, with participation from Normura Holdings. Existing investors Illuminate Financial, Jungle Ventures and SEEDs Capital also returned for the extension, which brings TookiTaki’s total Series A (first announced in March) to $19.2 million.

The company is using the funding to enhance their anti-money laundering (AML) and reconciliation software, and to hire for its offices in the United States, Singapore and India.

In a press statement, Viola Fintech general partner Tomer Michaeli said “With almost twenty years’ experience that Viola has in the AML sector, we found Tookitaki’s approach to be very unique. Its pragmatic way of creating an overlay on top of legacy AML systems helps increase accuracy and significantly lower operating costs for financial institutions. Moreover, its regulator-ready ‘glass box’ solution shows an innovative approach and a deep understanding of the challenges in the modern AML solutions market.”

[gallery ids=""1916308,1916307""]

TookiTaki was co-founded by CEO Abhishek Chatterjee and COO Jeeta Bandopadhyay in 2014. When TechCrunch reported on its seed round in 2015, the company provided data analytics to marketers. But it decided to focus its machine-learning platform for predictive analytics on regulatory compliance in late 2016 after realizing that there is a bigger business opportunity for vertical AI than a horizontal platform play, the founders told TechCrunch in an email.

Chatterjee was an associate at JP Morgan during the 2008 financial crisis and worked with U.S. regulators to make sure the bank’s products complied with new regulations. During that time, he says he realized that current anti-money laundering solutions reduced the effectiveness of compliance programs, and also struggled to keep up with the growth of digital banking and online transactions. Many legacy AML software had high false positive rates, TookiTaki’s founders say, and also missed activity by more sophisticated money launderers.

TookiTaki claims it reduces false positives for transaction monitoring by 50%, a result validated by Deloitte. Its software uses explainable machine learning models, which means their decisions are broken down in a way that can be easily understood by compliance staff, while providing them with the details they need for investigations. TookiTaki’s products can also help minimize costs by using a distributed computing framework, so it can be deployed in the cloud or on premise.

The software has two main modules: one that looks for suspicious transactions across different systems, and names screening, which screens for high-risk individual and corporate customers. Other TookiTaki features include machine learning algorithms that are constantly updating for new money laundering patterns and dividing alerts into low, medium and high-risk, making it easier for companies to figure out how to prioritize investigations.",0
311,"If we really want to know what makes terrorists commit atrocities, this is what we should do","In the last two and half years I’ve studied the motivations of terrorists so that I can better contribute to the debate about how to prevent future attacks. I’ve interviewed psychologists, former extremists, people who work with convicted terrorists in prison, senior police officers and victims.

The depressing conclusion is that, even looking at all the evidence, it’s incredibly hard to predict who will become a terrorist. That’s partly for good reasons – the cohort is so small that meaningful patterns are hard to observe. It’s also because the routes to terrorism can differ hugely. You might be an alcoholic, a career criminal with learning disabilities – or you might be a devout believer, unknown to the police and at the top of your class.

The better news is that there are models we can use to predict what makes terrorists act. The best model is based on the theory of reasoned action proposed by Fishbein and Ajzen in the 1970s. This approach – developed initially from looking at how consumers make decisions – suggests three beliefs need to be in place for action to result.

The first is the individual’s “behavioural belief”. In the context of terrorism that is their belief that terrorism is the right thing to do and will have the impact they want. That might be based on political, religious or ideological underpinnings – or it might be a much more personal motivation tied into wider dissatisfaction and anger.

The second is their “control belief”. This is whether they believe that they can successfully do it. In the past, the bar for this was high. Extremists who had the capacity to learn how to fly planes, build a detonator or get military training were few and far between. But as terror tactics have changed in the last few years, the bar has been massively lowered, thus enhancing extremists’ control belief.

The third is their “normative belief”. That’s essentially their faith in the idea that the people who they value will support their action. The importance of this normative belief is why marketers say things like “tickets are selling fast”, designed to convey that others are doing what you are considering. It’s why we crave likes and retweets on our social media, the modern stamp of social approval.

In the context of terror, this consists of a cohort of people (often online or in extremist groups) who will actually approve of the attack you might be considering; the advent of the internet has made finding these people much easier. But perhaps even more important are people in mainstream society who might not defend the actual act, but will justify it more subtly. The types of people who say “well of course I deplore the attack, but politicians have to know that immigration etc, etc...”, or “well of course I deplore the attacks but the war in Iraq etc, etc…”

So what does this model mean for our understanding of how we prevent terrorism?

Firstly, to shape people’s behavioural beliefs, we need to keep making arguments against violence and for tolerance. This sounds generic and it is. It’s the societal-wide battle of ideas that has to be won.

More specifically, we have to work harder to humanise groups who might be perceived as “other”. Dehumanisation is a necessary precondition for terror attacks and we can make that harder by talking about “the other” in more human terms. Even better, we can break down boundaries so that we meet “the other” in our normal lives. A proper integration and cohesion strategy is so important and so desperately missing in society.

The other factor is addressing the personal motivations. Lots of these have nothing to do with ideology and are a reflection of drug and alcohol problems, low-level mental health issues, the desire for status.

That’s why an effective counterterror policy will consider how to help address the personal motivations – perhaps with drug and alcohol services – to ensure that terrorists don’t get the kind of notoriety that might encourage others. What the New Zealand PM did this week in refusing to name the attacker was so important.

Secondly, we should work to attack extremists’ control beliefs. We can do that by funding the police adequately, protecting likely targets and making it even harder to get guns or explosives.

But both of these strands, while important, are difficult to substantially change. That’s because motivations are often much more personal than ideological, and because the bar of what constitutes a terror attack has been lowered so that almost anyone could be confident in their capacity to carry out a “successful” attack.

So that leaves the third and most important factor: extremists’ normative beliefs. This is what we as a society can have most impact on because it’s not about their beliefs, it’s about ours. That’s why social media companies have to change their approach to profiling hatred and channelling people towards it, it’s why the rhetoric of politicians like Donald Trump matters so much and it’s why societal-wide condemnation of attacks and hostile rhetoric is so important. But it’s not just companies and institutions that shape the environment, we all do.

That’s why Survivors Against Terror, a group of UK survivors of terror attacks, has encouraged everyone to play their part. Of course very few of us will ever meet a declared terrorist, but we will all meet or know people espousing hate against certain groups. Sometimes it’s tempting to ignore them, or pretend we didn’t see the post, or even nod along to avoid a row. But each time we do, we inadvertently create an environment more conducive to extremism.",0
545,An effective e-declaration system will be a watershed for the country,"BY MARCUS BRAND,

Two-and-a-half years ago, one of the core demands of the Euro-Maidan protests was curbing corruption. In 2014, the new reform government chose the fight against corruption as one of its strategic priorities.

At that pivotal moment, UNDP was honoured and proud to stand by Ukraine’s drivers of reform. Globally, in all the 140 or more countries where the United Nations Development Programme has its presence, we are working hand in hand with governments to help them solve issues and challenges that lead to effective democratic governance.

This time with the backing of the Government of Denmark, UNDP in Ukraine was able to render expert advice and financial assistance to help implement the reforms that were being charted out.

A new Anti-Corruption Strategy was adopted an enshrined in legislation that included the creation of a number of new institutions and mechanisms. Among the new anti-corruption tools UNDP was asked to help nurture, was the electronic asset declaration system.

The ambition of Ukrainian legislators at the time was to achieve a qualitative difference to earlier, largely ineffective anti-corruption tools and institutions. For such instruments to enjoy the trust and confidence of the wider public, they would have to significantly advance from earlier attempts that had been found to contain numerous loopholes and were largely considered ineffective.

In order for Ukraine’s new anti-corruption measures to gain the trust of both the population and its key international partners, they would have to be serious, ambitious and effective. Asset declarations are an integral component of corruption prevention and conflict-of-interest systems around the world, and they are enshrined as such in the UN Convention Against Corruption.

According to World Bank studies, 8 out of 10 high-income countries have already allowed public access to data contained in civil servants’ asset declarations. 60% of countries that have rendered such information open are also disclosing declared assets for officials’ spouses or life partners. In 85% of countries where an asset declaration system is in place for heads of state, ministers as well as rank and file civil servants, officials are also openly disclosing information on movable assets and cash savings.

In September 2015, the Government of Ukraine appealed to UNDP with a request to provide technical and financial support in developing an electronic asset declaration software in line with the new legislative requirements. As the National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP) had not been established by that time, the Ministry of Justice served as the lead agency for the Government of Ukraine in this matter.

UNDP subsequently ran an open and competitive tender for these works and fulfilled the request as asked, fully involving the newly-created NACP in all procedural steps; on 27 July, a software system for filing, publishing and storing officials’ declarations—fully functional and fully tested to be in line with Ukrainian legislation and the NACP’s own regulations—was transferred to the NACP as the system’s rightful Ukrainian owner.

Global experience shows that introducing paradigm shifts that suddenly and fundamentally change entrenched patterns of corruption, collusion and abuse of state power is fraught with challenges and bound to meet obstacles. The preparation and launch of Ukraine’s electronic declaration system is one of many examples for that.

Obviously, there are many who would rather not allow the public to know about their assets, and not always for legitimate reasons. And yet for public institutions and officials to regain genuine trust and to rebuild the social contract between the state and the people it may be essential to redraw the rules of the game.

Indeed, for anyone with control and influence over budget funds – which are to serve the general public rather than private interests – it is necessary to accept a degree of public oversight that must be balanced with their right to privacy.

It should also be said that the responsibility to prevent and fight corruption does not only lie with state officials, many of whom are expected to make do with meagre salaries and little prospect of raising their standards of living. Rather, what is now expected of state employees must set new standards of propriety and integrity all across society, one that is based on fair rules applicable to all rather than favours accessible to a few.

Ukraine now has a new asset declaration system that is far from perfect, bit it is still a huge improvement to the old paper-based system. The system in place has been fully in the hands of government bodies and has received all required technical and legal approvals.

As UNDP had contributed key elements of an earlier version of the software, we have been following the recent developments with great interest and some concern. Over the past weeks, it has become clear that there are significant differences between the original product delivered to NACP by UNDP and the currently operational software system. Some observers have even suggested that the currently operational online asset declaration forms may not be fully in line with the NACP’s own regulations and the Law of Ukraine “On Preventing Corruption”. We believe that there is still time for such inconsistencies to be addressed, if the system is to be considered robust and trustworthy.

Another cause for concern is that currently—two weeks prior to the submission deadline—only about 10% of the declarants have filed their online declarations. We are unsure whether this is due to lack of awareness of hesitation, but we expect that a massive last-minute run on the system could lead to a technical overload that would go beyond its current capabilities and therefore encourage all prospective declarants to submit their entries as soon as possible.

UNDP believes that the effective functioning of an e-declaration system, a cornerstone of Ukraine’s anti-corruption reforms, will be a watershed for the country. Ukraine’s international friends and partners rightly encourage it to take this decisive step towards better governance. UNDP has reconfirmed its readiness to assist national counterparts in translating commitments into realities, including by tackling the existing challenges with regard to the electronic declaration regime.

Despite the setbacks to be expected along the road, an effective asset declaration system that enjoys the trust of the Ukrainian people will be built, and it will allow Ukraine to move into a new era where corruption is an exception rather than the rule, and where public officials and civil servants are respected for serving the general public, rather than their own personal interests.

560,Building legal frameworks to protect people who reveal corruption,"Across Europe, Transparency International (TI) chapters are working hard to ensure that when countries adopt national legislation to transpose the EU Whistleblower Protection Directive, they meet and even exceed the Directive’s requirements, closing loopholes and ensuring safe reporting. Otherwise, many European citizens wanting to expose wrongdoing will lack protection.

The chapters can draw on rich shared experience in advocating for whistleblower protection. Taking varied approaches and developing expertise, we’ve helped achieve major milestones, from new whistleblower laws to improvements in reporting channels and building public support. On the way, we’ve learned valuable lessons about good practice for improving whistleblower protection.

Ensure fit-for-purpose legislation – with public support

The starting place is ensuring the right to blow the whistle is enshrined in strong legislation – our chapters helped to achieve this goal across Europe. TI France worked closely with the government and MPs to replace the country’s piecemeal whistleblowing laws with comprehensive protection. When the government proposed a law on transparency, anti-corruption and modernisation of the economy, including whistleblower provisions, the chapter dropped its call for standalone legislation and campaigned for comprehensive protection within the government’s bill. During a long parliamentary process, it worked closely with the Fondation Sciences Citoyennes to build a wide coalition of support, including civil society, trade unions, the media and the public. Together, they ensured the inclusion and then prevented the dilution of whistleblower provisions in the bill and in 2016, France passed one of the world’s most comprehensive whistleblower protection laws.

TI Italy also seized opportunities and built alliances to drive through the country’s whistleblowing law in 2017. When populist party, the Five Star Movement, championed whistleblower protection, the chapter helped it draft a comprehensive whistleblowing bill and build political, civil society and public support for its passage. TI Italy’s ongoing advocacy finally won backing from the majority Democratic party – an unlikely ally for Five Star. When the bill stalled in the Senate, TI Italy kick-started the process, coordinating a civil society support network and running widespread media and online campaigns. Collaborating with Riparte il Futoro (now The Good Lobby), it launched a public petition, collecting more than 55,000 signatures and creating momentum for passage of the law, which was adopted in December 2017.

Develop a widespread whistleblowing culture

Developing a widespread culture of social support is crucial. Chapters use current events, such as Ireland’s policing scandal, and harness the power of human stories to influence public opinion and help sway top politicians toward legislating.

TI France and its civil society partners won public support for whistleblower legislation by highlighting experiences of individual whistleblowers such as medic Irène Frachon and accountant Antoine Deltour. People empathised with the reprisals they faced and engaged with the issues they exposed – deadly medication and corporate tax avoidance. Human stories create public pressure, which officials and lawmakers respond to as professionals and as members of society themselves.

Push for effective enforcement

But laws alone aren’t enough. They must be fully implemented and enforced if they’re to work. This is why Transparency International chapters monitor whether the authorities are overseeing proper implementation of and enforcing whistleblower laws.

Under Slovakia’s 2015 law, the country’s regional labour inspectorates were responsible for enforcement. Yet they received no additional resources or training, and showed no signs of activity around whistleblower protection. When TI Slovakia assessed the inspectorates’ capacity to enforce the law, it found serious shortcomings. Following the publication of TI Slovakia’s report, the inspectorates asked the chapter to train their staff and develop guidance for whistleblowers. TI Slovakia also started to advocate for effective oversight of whistleblower protection. In 2018, it helped secure amendments to Slovakia’s whistleblowing law, including provision for an independent authority to oversee enforcement (in force since March 2019).

Behind those achievements is the credibility of Transparency International chapters as whistleblower experts. Chapters work to develop a profound understanding of all aspects of reporting – through giving help to individual whistleblowers via our network of Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres, listening to pioneering organisations, and engaging with political, corporate and institutional opponents of whistleblowing to understand and address their concerns.

Securing laws and enforcing them are the foundation-stones of strong whistleblower protection – but they’re only part of the picture. Find out how our chapters work innovatively to facilitate implementation and change business practices to protect people with the courage to speak up.",0
